10,"One of the few films that can be granted the title of ""masterpiece"".",That's it. That's all I'm writing about this film. Now go watch it if you haven't already.,"Dec 20, 2019"
10,Really good,Good movie to watch when u are boring Really recommended!!,"Aug 14, 2019"
10,Scariest movie I've experienced.,This movie had me terrified the entire time which is incredibly rare. Easy 10. I've never experienced something like this.,"Mar 26, 2020"
10,A Grifter Great,"When you write a review this late into a movie's life, post-genre busting Oscar, nobody will read this stuff, so here goes nothing. I've always liked the con men / grifter genre because it's all about the glorious world of deceit, where nothing is as it seems. Typically the drama comes when the best laid plan falls apart, which it does so gloriously and tragically here. I'm looking forward to the black and white version, as there's a glorious luminosity to that format, and this picture really doesn't require color.","Feb 17, 2020"
10,A thrilling and hilarious masterpiece.,"Man, where do I even begin? Let's start with the technical aspects. It is shot very well, the production design is so good that I couldn't tell what was real and what wasn't, the acting is phenomenal (especially from Joon Ho favorite Kang-Ho Song), and the score is the best of the year so far.

And now for the story. Just wow. The script tackles so many complicated themes about society and class flawlessly, and it developes all of the characters perfectly. There are about 8 main characters, and they all feel like actual people and not objects for the story. The situation that the characters get in is very interesting and thrilling. This is the best film of the year, and one of the best ever. Just watch it.","Oct 10, 2019"
10,Well deserved an Oscar,It is pulling you into reality and at the same time to the illusion. Showing both side and connecting them well. Spectacular ending. Congrats!,"Nov 27, 2020"
10,It is a class-conscious thriller that you wouldn't want to miss!,"Saw Parasite yesterday. Something that we missed out during MAMI. What a brilliant gripping tale this is! It is a class-conscious thriller that you wouldn't want to miss.

To start with, it makes you laugh with its comic rendering. When you see the entire movie it defies all your expectations along the line. Bong Joon-ho crafts an intricate look at modern-day social hierarchies. He keeps you flipped on one mood then drastically changes it to the other while delivering some brilliant thematic elements. When you spend 132 minutes seeing this movie you encounter and experience: clever, humorous, dramatic and every other kind of emotion.

It is also a hilarious and irreverent take on South Korea's class warfare. I cannot overstate how refreshing Parasite is both as a genius piece of arthouse cinema, but also a very contemporary comedy of errors. Parasite is so sublime because it can be watched for pure entertainment value of a sly poor family manipulating gullible elites into paying them for various services, but Parasite also wades in deep waters of sympathy for its poor desperate souls.

It is an outstanding South Korean dark comedy that will stand up to the ages. Its final moments are so unsettling, and so unforgettable and impossible to estimate. It is a test that you undergo yourself and you're most likely to fail! 😊","May 8, 2020"
10,Parasite,"Bong Jon Hoo has created a masterpiece; Parasite hits every genre throughout the film from thriller, horror, comedy & mystery just to name a few. You never know what's going to come next & it had me at the edge of my seat from start to finish. I recommend watching the B&W version as it gives a different experience. One of my favorite films of all time, can't recommend this film enough; no wonder it's claimed every prize in the industry, throughly deserved!","Aug 23, 2022"
10,Dark Reality,"I can't get over how it ended, everything comes at a cost every decision has its consequence. It's dark realistic thrilling and sometimes funny. This fits to many different genres.","Jul 29, 2021"
10,Beautiful Masterpiece,"I just want to leave my opinion on this masterpiece, I love films from South Korea, and what makes me love them even more are these films that leave me thinking for three days in a row, the fact that the film always has several meanings and is brilliant I love the fact that every little detail always has a meaning, they are films like these with symbolism, mystery and messages to make the audience think that they are the best films for me!","Feb 4, 2020"
10,"It left me silent, then came tears.","Truly, something to remember. Thank god we have good film makers left. Everything in place. I Only hated that I could not undertand language, liked to think that I picked something on the way.","Jun 14, 2020"
10,This is what a parasite actually is,"Parasite was awesome. From the screenwriting to the acting, this was a film. This was a beautiful film. From the twist and turns it makes, to the surprise ending. Parasite had it all. I wish I was able to have seen it sooner but no theaters near me were playing it. But it's ok because I watched it and loved every second of it. The world this movie brings together, between wealthy and poor. This was a beautifully shot film and had me on the edge of my seat throughout the whole thing. I don't want to talk too much about the film because I don't want to spoil it, so please. Go see Parasite, you will not regret it.","Feb 24, 2020"
10,Best Movie ever made,"I really loved this movie, you should also at least give it a try.","Feb 14, 2020"
10,Uncomfortably good.,This isn't a feel-good movie. It is is the cold harsh reality of whatever the movie's message was. I was too grasped on the story itself to see the bigger picture. That could be the message itself. It really took my perspective of life and twisted it.,"Feb 19, 2020"
10,The Irritating Masterpiece,"The blurring of the rich-poor divide occurs when the poor family becomes increasingly entangled in the life of the wealthy family they pretend to serve. The usage of the home as a symbol emphasizes this theme, with the basement symbolizing the poor family's poverty and the upstairs signifying the affluent family's money and privilege.

The film also focuses on the concept of the ""parasitic single,"" which refers to adult children who live with their parents and are unable to leave owing to a lack of work and financial security. It also depicts the influence of capitalism on individuals and how difficult it is to break out from the cycle of poverty.

The film also emphasizes the topic of survival, as the impoverished family would go to any length to live, even if it means misleading and manipulating the wealthier family.

It's crucial to remember that this film is a social commentary and a mirror of present society's reality; it may be uncomfortable to see, but it's necessary to comprehend the message it's attempting to portray.

Bong Joon-ho directed the 2019 South Korean black comedy thriller film Parasite. The narrative follows the Kim family, an impoverished family of four living in a tiny semi-basement apartment. When the son, Ki-woo, is given the opportunity to teach the Park's daughter, they become entangled in the life of the rich Park family. As Ki-woo gets increasingly involved in the Parks' life, the rest of the Kim family begins to enter the Parks' lives in various ways, with each member taking on a position as a tutor or employee.

The film tackles issues of class struggle and social inequity, as the Kim family's actions set in motion a chain of events that reveal the two families' underlying tensions and secrets. The film also deals with themes of greed and the consequences of actions.

The performances of the ensemble, and the film's unusual combination of genres. It was the first South Korean film to win the Palme d'Or at the 2019 Cannes Film Festival. It also won Academy Awards for Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Original Screenplay, becoming Bong Joon-ho the first Asian director to win Best Director at the Oscars.

The film received widespread praise for its superb acting, director, storyline, and depiction of societal concerns and class conflict. It was also a box office triumph in South Korea and internationally.

When Parasite was released, it gained critical praise, with many applauding Bong Joon-directing.

Parasite is a complicated film that explores a variety of topics and subjects that may make viewers uncomfortable, including class disparity, poverty, and the rich's abuse of the poor. The film also addresses the concept of deceit, as the film's impoverished family pretends to be someone they are not in order to get entry to the rich household. Furthermore, the film's finale is unexpected and may be upsetting to some viewers.

It's natural for people to react differently to a film, and it's vital to remember that art is subjective and can elicit various feelings in different people.

Parasite is a thought-provoking and expertly constructed film that addresses complicated societal themes in an original and fascinating manner. Its unique combination of genres, great performances, and expert directing by Bong Joon-ho make it a must-see picture.","Jan 26, 2023"
10,Palme d'Or winner,"Outstanding balance between arthouse and mainstream. Solid acting, impressive direction, beautiful shooting, intense narration, unconvetional humor and story development. Brilliant.","Aug 3, 2020"
10,Once in a lifetime experience,"If you are hesitant to watch it because of the subtitles, don't be. This is a phenomenal movie which literally deserves it's own genre.

10,Wll crafted,"Cinematic Masterpiece with a mixed genre. A film that will hold you up and never bore you not even for a second. Its storyline, drastic drama which leaps up the story. Its an tecnical masterpiece cause Boon jong ho knows what he is doing and he crafted it well. If you asked is it the movie of the decade? Well, i can't tell it but it will be in the list. Haooy watch.","Feb 25, 2020"
10,Mazza,"Bit of a mazza throughout cannot lie. Mazza at the start, big mazza middle, mega mazza end. Overall, top mazza","Feb 12, 2020"
10,Caution: deeply unsettling,"To be honest, normally, I do not fancy such type of movies, especially asian movies, this one, well, it nearly kills you. It starts somehow slow, even boring, maybe a touch of comedy, but then, then the second half of it is just a nightmare focusing on society and it's negative aspects. This movie kept me awake for many hours at night and will always remind me of so many things like to be thankful for what you have and how to approach others. Check out yourself. For sure, one of the true oscar winners! Fully deserved!","Feb 17, 2020"
10,Amazing,"First off, I feel like you either get this movie or you don't, that simple. There Is so much thought provoking duality that comes into play, those who rate it poorly seem to miss this part of the story. I don't want to give spoilers but if you truly allow yourself to go on the emotional roller coaster that this movie is, it will leave you thinking about all the twists and turns for days.","Jan 17, 2020"

10,Masterpiece,In 3 alphabets...wow... this movie transforms from dark comedy to family drama to a thriller to family drama with spellbinding sequences and perfect choreography. Keep entertaining us with such awesome cinema.,"Jul 8, 2020"
10,Perfect masterpiece,"I don't understand anyone giving this film anything less than a 9 or 10. It takes genius twists and turns, and I don't even usually like this genre! As for those not understanding certain character motives: please open your mind and consider cultural differences regarding boundaries, insults, manners, and class divides.","Feb 12, 2020"
10,A Masterpiece,"This movie is honestly a masterpiece. I was so happy when it won best picture. ITs pacing is great, it has so many twists and turns that you are constantly invested in what is happening.

It looks gorgeous too!

The characters are so well formed and the script is just great. It funny too.

People are often put off by subtitled films but i wish they would give them a chance as they miss out on films like this and more importantly foreign films fail to reach commercial success.

So if you are at all interested in what you have heard about this movie, watch it you will love it.","May 20, 2020"
10,nice,"Its a nice movie.it showes the reality of two different world.korean movies and drams never disappoint always good entertainment. Definitely a MUST WATCH film from 2019, this Palme d'Or winner of Cannes Film Festival sure does not disappoint with it's hard hitting themes and exceptionally crafted story. Parasite really is the kind of remarkable experience that makes modern movie-going/Binge-watching such a joy. South Korean filmmaker Bong Joon-ho already has an impeccable track record, but he's stepped up his game with this brilliant, powerfully revealing social satire. I had no expectations walking into Parasite, but now my love and appreciation for it has breached the stratosphere. This is definitely one of the best movies of 2019, and it's bound to be a classic.","Dec 28, 2023"
10,"Another south Korean Masterpiece ,Some people those saying movie overhyped? should check up their mind first","A great movie with outclass direction,Script,Story,Acting,Music all was too good,even before this movie south korea produce many masterpiece but we surprised win first time Cannes Prestigious ( Palm Di""or Award ,France) BAFTA( UK) Australian Academy award,Golden Globe , Screen Actor guild award & Oscar award etc this the only movie was in Oscar(2020) was tottaly deserve to win Best direction,Best movie,Best orignal script award","Apr 7, 2020"
10,"Nothing ""foreign"" about it","Hollywood's ""foreign"" classifications should be immediately done away with. What does the designation tell us about this extraordinary movie to call it ""foreign""? Foreign to whom and in what way? Yep, I get it, not made in America (Hollywood) and not in English. That designation means nothing used for a movie of such universal themes so easily accessible to the viewer. The director has observed the Kurosawa principle about balancing all the elements of the film's language, in addition to keeping to his own approach of keeping the narrative and dramatic aspects simple. Even with subtitles I was laughing out loud at the humorous bits. Can western movies claim that when they're subtitled in other languages? This sublime simplicity results in a movie so finely calibrated that it wipes out in one fell swoop the tiresome arthouse talking head cinematic tradition of the west. The South Korean film isn't ""foreign"", it's smack in the middle of a filmmaking tradition that respects the story, the viewer and the very medium of film. Think Kurosawa, again. How sublime in their simplicity are his movies? Critics carry in about what genre it is? What political and sociological commentary the director is trying out. None of that matters when a movie is so tonally pitch perfect. The ""change"" of pace about half way through is so seamless, one gasps long after the last frame that it couldn't possibly have gone any other way. It's the power of the impeccable story telling via the medium of film that elevates this movie above the fray. Editing, acting, cinematography are all pitch perfect. Hollywood, go cry in your pretzels, with your endless commercial blockbusters and franchises. The centre of gravity has shifted and you are now the ""foreigner"" while the South Korean holds court in the center of the global cinematic universe. Thank you for giving it the ""best"" picture award full stop. It is one of the greatest films of all time in its tone, seamlessness, simplicity, and both the humour and tragedy of the human story it depicts. A great, great, great cinematic experience. Ten stars barely begins to convey the greatness.","Apr 17, 2020"
10,Masterpiece,"Perfectly told story with perfectly logical plots and motives for every character, justification for every frame and accompanied by a thought-provoking message that lingers long after you leave the theatre. Surely one of the best of cinema.","Dec 26, 2019"
10,It's a masterpeice,I've never watched a movie like this one. It's a masterpiece.,"Jun 2, 2020"
10,Movie of the year,"The best movie of 2019 has everything: great acting, fabulous screenplay, with funny, tense and plot-twist moments, excelent directing, social critics and acid jokes. A monumental (but easy-to-consume) piece of art that satisfies all audience's tastes. Highly recommended.","Dec 12, 2019"
10,Masterpiece,"Parasite is a masterpiece, an unpredictable film about class division that skillfully manages to easily combine different genres and create a truly unique and complex experience that's smart, funny and tense. All of the performances are incredible with Kang-ho Song, Woo-sik Choi and So-dam Park giving the standout performances. Bong Joon-ho's direction is incredible, it's beautifully filmed and the pacing is superb, constantly extremely engaging for the entirety of its run time. The music by Jung Jae-il is amazing.","Feb 7, 2020"
10,No words to prais this masterpeic,I just finished this movie. This whole movie give an amazing experience. The story is beyond our imagination. The performance of the all cast is just outstanding. It's a must watch for all movie lovers.,"Feb 18, 2020"
10,BEST MOVIE OF 2019!!,"This movie is a masterpiece. It is well casted and acted, the cinematography was very well done. The themes are thought provoking. But the greatest thing about this movie is how much love, effort and dedication went into this. This movie has every genre in it, yet it doesn't feel too cramped. It might be unrealistic and some parts but the story was so amazing. The little details in this movie is what makes it a modern day masterpiece.

Parasite is one of those movies that you will never forget and rewatch it over and over again. It is such a fine experience watching this movie, and everything is perfect about it. 10/10","Jan 7, 2020"
10,parasite,This movie is really great korean movie with great cast and just idea for this movie is unique and it is one of best foreign movies out there,"Sep 4, 2019"
10,K-Blockbuster: Cinematic K-Pop,"I came to see this hyped-out title and was expecting to see it flop, only to be amazed by its brilliance and cinematography. Simplicity without a doubt is the ultimate sophistication.

I feel Parasite was an infastation to Western cinematography, taking all tip awards and leaving nothing behind. Eastern cinema has a lot more to offer than cheesy martial arts and special effects, and Parasite is the gateway towards this level of cinematic appreciation.

This movie portrays a lower-class family, making ends meet and struggling to survive in a capitally oriented world, by skipping into the higher layer of society. Although they have less to show, they are more of a family than their higher-class counterpart, living the life of riches without ever fully experiencing any of it together. In a way, it blends and clearly separates these two worlds, similair in essence but completely different in reality.

It is a manifesto on class struggles and how social stratification represents an unpenetrable rock wall, where a lifetime is not enough to break free and move to a higher layer. Because of this, you are forced to become a parasite and take from others to grow, or remain a parasite of society and depend on the generousity of the Rich.

In the end, one has to wonder if Capital is a true parasite of our lives, taking our focus from the importance of the human experience and manipulating our life's purpose as it pleases?","Feb 28, 2020"
10,"Both comedy and tragedy, a fierce social satire","This movie, starting as a clever comedy turns into a deep drama in a modern context of social inequities. This movie undelines how social classes remain splitted in today's world (almost as spltited as in Gosford Park). It also questions how the poor working class have to struggle against itself to benefit from the little that can runoff from the rich ones. Great actor playing and the right pace in the movie makes it a fantastic experience.","Aug 12, 2019"
10,Brilliant and totally unpredictable,"This film goes places where few dare to wonder. It begins as a dark, hilarious comedy but evolves into a startling, violent climex I will never forget. Everything about the film is exceptional. It is a true masterpiece.","Oct 17, 2019"
10,10/10 for sure but too much hype,"The movie is great movie, unique and exciting. I just think it was too hyped up. I believe this is first time Americans saw Korean Thriller. That could be the reason it won so many Oscars. I can name several other Korean movie with actually same Actor in it, that are better movies. Don't get me wrong this was great movie and I really really enjoyed it but the way every single person made it into the greatest movie they've see ...well it's not or probably those people haven't seen enough videos. It's fun and exciting movie it's a must watch for any movie lover.","Nov 28, 2021"
10,A disturbing and hilarious ride.,"The film had me from the beginning and the very end of it was disturbing and sad. I didn't expect the dad to just hide underground for the rest of his life. Great film, reccommend it.","Aug 17, 2020"
10,The best film in the last decade,"I am remarkably stingy with my 10/10 ratings. I'll be the first person to acknowledge this. If this isn't a masterpiece, then I don't know what is.

I was really excited to see it progress and unfold in satisfying, unexpected ways. Never expected, from the cast to director. I forced my friends to watch and everybody agreed with me.","May 4, 2020"
10,Eat the Rich,"I loved this movie. I was laughing almost the whole time and when I wasn't, I was holding my hand over my mouth with surprise. Every twist and turn of the story is paced and delivered. Every character is spot on.

I love a film with a message, and this one is loud and clear.

You should watch it. I don't care that it's in Korean, you should watch it.","Feb 15, 2020"
10,Not overrated,"I went in thinking it would be completely over-hyped and that the park family would be archetypal immoral rich people, but all the characters were well rounded, and although I didn't share Mr. Kim's viewpoint it is completely understandable. Parasite got its message across without being textbook, rich-people-bad post-modernist drivel, I didn't feel like my class was being criticized for no reason. The whole 2nd half had my jaw on the floor and gripping my seat, while the 1st half had my laughing every few lines. This movie is well worth the watch, and entirely lived up to the hype","Aug 17, 2020"
10,A wonderful black comedy,"This movie is great it's hilarious, gripping and intense the less you know before seeing it the better","Dec 5, 2019"
10,ART,"ITS A MASTERPIECE IF IT WERE A PAINTING IT WOULD BELONG IN THE LOUVRE

Aesthetics Accuracy Humour Empathy

Thank you Bong","Jun 23, 2020"
10,Parasite,"I am remarkably stingy with my 10/10 ratings. I'll be the first person to acknowledge this. Of the roughly 2600 titles I've rated on here, only 34 have a 10. Parasite is one of them. If this isn't a masterpiece, then I don't know what is.

I'm going to keep it vague on the plot-front, because I didn't know anything about it going in, and was really excited to see it progress and unfold in satisfying, unexpected ways.

What I will say is that this film, more than just about any other I've seen, put me through so many different emotional states during its 132-minute runtime, and did so without ever feeling muddled or tonally inconsistent. Parts of this movie were hilarious. Parts were heartbreaking. Other parts were insanely suspenseful (I'm honestly not sure if I've felt this close to the edge of my seat since the final season of Breaking Bad, way back in 2013).

And it does all this while being perfectly paced, beautifully directed, and amazingly acted from every single member of its cast. All the characters are understandable and sympathetic to some degree; the amount of conflict, drama and tension derived from a narrative with no clear heroes and villains is staggering. You come to care for just about all of them.

I'm stumped to come up with any flaws for this movie. And sure, I've seen many movies that are hard to fault, but it's rare that a movie appeals to me on a gut level and excites me to this degree while also being so close to technically perfect. It's extremely entertaining, thoroughly moving in so many different ways, and as icing on the cake there's a ton of social commentary and some heavy themes to chew on once the movie's over (and this one's not going to leave my head for a while, I can tell).

Catch this one when you can and believe the hype. Joon-Ho Bong has made many great films (and so far no bad one's), but this even manages to stand head and shoulders above all the others.

When it comes time to consider what the best film of the 2010s was, this one will surely be up there.","Jan 11, 2024"

10,MUST MUST MUST SEE!,"I don't often give a 10 but I simply have no complaints. This was an enthralling watch - even as I watched it with the subtitles! So smart. There were many angles and I'm not sure what the genre is. First the humour got me, then the characters got me, then the main plot got me, then the drama got me, the sadness got me and the horror got me. So entertaining, eyes peeled kind of stuff. You have no idea where its going to go. I found myself really rooting for the main characters and the topics are so relevant. Korean cinema - i am watching out for gems like this. Really, a clever, entertaining brilliant film. Watch it.","Aug 25, 2019"
10,Greatest movie of 2019 EASILY!,I watched this right after I was blown away by joker and didn't think anything that year could get better.,"Jan 28, 2020"
10,It's hands down one of my top five,The movie is delivered so artistically while being interesting the whole way through. The hole the characters dig themselves into get deeper exponentially and you're completely on edge the last twenty minutes. Immediately after the movie I was shook to the core. Afterwards I had to do a lot of thinking to fully process what I just watched and understand the social messages. Amazing movie and I know for sure this is not going to get the attention it deserves because it is a Korean film.,"Nov 27, 2019"

The lower class struggle and the way they see and feel jealous of the upper class even unknowingly is beautifully presented. Must watch for any human nature observer.","Aug 19, 2021"
10,It's a masterpiece. Because Bong Joon Ho,"It's pretty difficult to rate a movie 10 out of 10. Either because is full of cliches, or maybe it's stupid, or too much Hollywood action, you name it.... any movie has a flaw.

Except for Bong Joon Ho movies. This guy is like a total GOD of movies, a guru in it's true sense.

For those of you which seen other movies of this guy, you will know immediately what I mean.

His movies are unique. You can't compare them with something else. And Parasite is just one of them which has no equal.

The title is self explanatory. You can't name this movie otherwise once you see it. This is true a story about parasites, how they infect a host and kill it in the end.","Apr 5, 2020"
10,WOW.,Just WOW. I loved every second of this film. The cinematography is on point! Such a beautiful film and such a great plot! Go see this movie!!,"Jan 17, 2020"
10,where to start?,"There's so much to love about this film. From its acting, music, set piece, cinematography, props and more, Bong finds some way to compress so much into a 2+ hour film and the quality is still perfect. The many themes and genres this film has, comedy, satire, drama, horror, thriller, family, you still don't get confused on what your watching no matter the theme or genre the scene is centred around. The films main message about rich and poor was portrayed comedically and horrifically. There's just too much to write about in one preview that a reader will stay attentive to, but the film very much deserved it's 4 oscar wins. no English remake please thanks","Dec 4, 2020"
10,Excellent,"Impressive, uncomfortable, a masterpiece. at times you can feel the smell that the moments emanate","Sep 16, 2020"
10,if you haven't seen it for the first time I envy you,"Delightful from beginning to end, opening is way in between genres, loved the pace, the comedy, the ending, the twist, the characters, pretty much everything.

I'm just waiting to rewatch it and pick new details.

if you do (watch it) please do it in the cinema and maybe you will get a crowd like mine that bonded trough the laughs and the shock and ended up talking about it outside.

And If you end up thinking is overrated it's okey, but you will still end up thinking about it for days.","Jan 16, 2020"
10,One of the few movies that is gonna be remembered for a long time,"Honstly i never feel the need to write review but this one.. Wow i cant say anything coz it will ruin the surprise. But really , you would get out from the cinema feeling a mixture of everything.

This is genius. 🙌🏻🙌🏻","Jul 22, 2019"
10,Didn't see it coming,"The story Rolls a long as you'd expect but then gets out of control quickly. You could see it happening in real life and being one of those weird stories you read in the paper and think ""how does that happen today"". Stays with you. Understand the rave reviews.

10,Parasite was the single best film I saw in 2019.,"It's important to go in as fresh as possible to enjoy the film's juicy surprises, which are unraveled with the craft of a master, steadily building characters into the scheme, inviting our complicity, then yanking out the rug.","Sep 29, 2020"
10,Subtle and subversive depiction of the society,"With not a moment that seems unnecessary or extra, 'Parasite' is exceptionally well-paced and edited (Yang Jin-mo). Director Bong Jon-ho masterfully constructs stylized, dramatic sequences set to a brilliant background score (Jung Jae-il) as the film rapidly moves from one plot point to another. It results in a gripping yet poignant watch. The ensemble cast enhance the proceedings with superlative performances, especially Song Kang-ho, Park So-dam and Choi Woo-shik.

With an insightful and searing exploration of human behavior, 'Parasite' is a masterfully crafted film that is a definite must watch.","Jun 22, 2021"

10,Banned in Canada,"Just like the movie The Shape of Water ..... this movie is for all intensive purposes banned in Canada .....

From the Cineplex site: The movie Parasite (Korean w/e.s.t.) is not playing in TORONTO - ON on 11/16/2019

It is playing in Oakville in 1 theater. I will play the local art theater that seats 30 in my town later this month.

Interestingly, Google Play has this movie and even has reviews BUT it is not rent-able or buy-able in Canada.

Parasite is about the caste systems that operate worldwide, including Canada .... and is a taboo topic","Nov 16, 2019"
10,A TRUE MASTERPIECE..,"Story All unemployed, Ki-taek and his family take peculiar interest in the wealthy and glamorous Parks, as they ingratiate themselves into their lives and get entangled in an unexpected incident. REVIEW As the title suggests PARASITE..it symbolizes the entire plot of the film..the film starts off at a comedy film.. And slowly it turns into a intense thriller.. And finally into a horror film... The film focuses about the rich and poor.. Their goals and aims which bother us.. Exactly before the interval and the climax.. Characters in the film lay a foundation of extreme cinematic experience which was all spine chilling and mind boggling for sure.. The performance delivered by the KOREAN actors was stupendous and flawless.. The details introduced by the director was truly a masterpiece.. It was a great experience.. RATING 4.0/5.0","Feb 7, 2020"
10,"OMG... this is how I was almost the whole movie, with the hand in my mouth and my eyes wide open.","This was like watching the Godfather, Inception and The Panic room in a refined version of the 20's... but with its own bizarre, funny, and at the same time beautiful unique style that only Bong Joon could make... 8,6/10???? this is a 10/10 film, Bong Joon is one of the best writers/directors in the world, Okja was the ultimatum film that defined he was a genius, his first ""masterpiece"", and he did it again this time! such a elegant film, with such a perfect timing and edition, for moments it looked like an orchestra more than a film, actually, the whole film has beautiful classic orchestra in the background, a beautiful piece of music called orchestra that hides another orchestra but more complex, creepy and sad called life, it's like a methaphore inside a methaphore, inside of a more complex methaphore, u get it??? IT'S FREAKING GENIUS!! the first minutes of the movie were a little slow, like all the Bong Joon films, but I knew the rythm will come, and how it arrived was brillant, the tension was exquisite, the photography is so clean, the art of this film is so refined as all the other elements, script, acting, plot, HOW CAN SOMEONE GIVE THIS BRILLANT FILM SOMETHING LESS THAN 10??? WHO LET THAT PEOPLE VOTE PLEASE!!! 8,6/10 IS THE REASON WHY WE HAVE SHARKNADO MOVIES IN THE RUNNING TIMES :/","Feb 19, 2020"
10,Parasite is many different movies all at the same time.,"It works on so many levels it means so many things to different people you can see it in the reviews that are across youtube, rottentomatoes, etc.. Everyone has something different that sticks out for them and yet this film blends it so well.

I know for a fact that this movie will be considered up there with The Godfather and Pulp Fiction in due time. It only just won Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Foreign Film Oscars and people will slowly start studying it more and more. When you see the best analysis channels like Nerdwriter write glowing essays on Parasite you know its hit its mark very deeply.

Outward differences aside, this movie IMO is very similar to the ""What Could Go Wrong?"" Genre like in No Country for Old Men, A Simple Plan, but its also such a study and understanding in different socio-economic class, poor vs rich, and its fourth act is very Hitchcock.. This movie will stick with you and I am just glad that I was alive to see this movie. That's how good it is.","Feb 16, 2020"
10,Mixed Genre,"If you're looking for a comedy, brutal, dark and drama movie,this is the movie for you. The way they switched from one genre to another is so smooth you'll enjoy every bit of minute watching it. The whole story line is great. 😁","Aug 14, 2019"

10,Masterpiece,"This was one of the most entertaining and enthralling movies I'd seen all year. Everything, from the pacing, filming, characters, story, and dialogue all converge upon the viewer's brain, exciting them neurons like fireworks, bathing our cortices with explosive brain juice! Every scene has a purpose, and builds upon the story, leading up to its climatic ending.","Jan 16, 2020"
10,Not a Big Fan of Subtitles but.....,"My movie viewing has matured over the years as it should, but still not a fan of subtitles but films like this has changed my mind and rightfully so. The movie is so good that after you watch it twice(which you will if you loved it) you barely have to read them not because of predictably but because it says exactly what you're thinking and its brilliant screenplay and directing. Sometimes reading subtitles and culture of other countries are hard to put altogether, not this time. The film is emotional, funny(dark), endearing, suspenseful, and exactly what movies are supposed to hit on. It's a home run and don't let the low ratings steer you away from this, it almost did me but, once again I overcame my angst and settle in for actually one of the best movies I've ever seen--definitely the Best Foreign movie I've ever had the pleasure of watching. Give that Parasite a hand and A OSCAR well deserved!","Aug 10, 2021"

Guess they are four now!

4. Parasite (2019)","Aug 9, 2021"
10,ONE OF THE GREATEST FILMS EVER MADE,"I just watched ""Parasite"" for the first time. It is currently February and I watched the film for the first time around Thanksgiving. I loved it back then and I love it even more now. Definitely is one of my ALL TIME FAVORITE MOVIES. This movies plot is absolutely insane but that is not the important part of the movie. It is really a story about trying to move up in the world and how that's an impossibility. And that even the hope can destroy you. The movie is thrilling, beautifully directed, heart felt, etc.. Also, from a re-watch point of view you pick up many new points of analysis and get to notice how beautifully edited this movie is. I want to write more but that would get into spoilers and you would stop reading. But watching this movie is a NECESSITY.","Feb 20, 2020"
10,Thrilled!,"I just can't believe it... no matter how many times I watch this movie, it always has an impact on me. It always leaves such strong emotions, it makes you wonder about many things, especially your way of thinking and behaving towards people. I love this movie and I am forever grateful for it - it shows how money makes the world go round... and not in a good way.","Oct 7, 2021"

10,totally overrated,Good but definitely not worth an Oscar for best movie or best director.,"Feb 26, 2020"
10,A masterful emotional rollercoaster,"Bong Joon-Ho is an outstanding director, and this might be his best work yet. Parasite is one of the best movies of the entire decade, hell I'd go as far as saying no other movie this decade quite matches it. It's funny, it's heartbreaking, it's intense. It does all of this while not feeling tonally inconsistent or confused, which is something that many films fail to do. The acting is incredible and the characters themselves are fantastic, with no good guys or bad guys: They're people. They feel like real and believable characters, which is such a refreshing change of pace from all of the bloated action movies that we get every year. It's well shot, as to be expected, and the social commentary is fantastic.

This is the first movie I've seen in the longest time that I can describe as perfect, I loved every single bit of it.","Jan 16, 2020"
10,Riveting and beautifully shot,"Saw it in black and white, the score is fantastic, and balanced horrifying topics with hilarious ones. A MASTERPIECE","Mar 16, 2020"
10,A masterpiece,One of his best works. Builds unlike many movies and comes to an end in fantastic fashion. A must watch and hooks you to the point that you don't even realize you are reading subtitles.,"May 26, 2020"
10,"Top notch, easily goes does down into the top 1% of the charts.",Theme of the movie is unmatched. An experience of division between classes. Bringing reality so subtly onto the screen.,"Feb 22, 2020"
10,Masterpiece.,"In the opening scene the family is underground where is sad and dark=(povert), as Kim's family moves toward they move in to the light=(hope,wealth), how ever when the things fall apart, light disappeared and the family moves back to darkness, the final shot reflects the firts one but now is way more darker. Also when the rain star they ran many stairs signifying that they are going back to where they come from. And also in the begging the dad said he hates cockroaches but at the end he becomes one.","Sep 13, 2021"
10,Favorite Film of 2019,"Family of cons get in deeper than they intended while trying to live a life they don't deserve. Unexpected twists and startling action, which does not deviate too far from possible reality.","Mar 29, 2020"
10,Don't have any expectations,This movie surprises you by every new scene. I couldn't say what genre the movie is but it delivers a whole experience. I had no idea what the movie is about in the beginning but it is worth it. Shows perfectly in a dramatical and comedian way the differences between rich and poor,"Aug 18, 2019"
10,This is a perfect movie.,"There are no flaws. It has transcended film itself. It's funny, scary, sad, and gripping from start to finish. As one critic put it, ""It's a magic trick.""

I don't care if you ""can't take subtitles,"" or whatever. I can easily recommend this film to anybody. Please watch it and support foreign, arthouse, and indie cinema. But I implore you: go in blind.

And I'm hoping for a Best Picture win at the Oscars.

Bong Joon-ho's masterpiece.","Dec 4, 2019"
10,A masterpiece ! Just speechless ...,"I forgot I was watching a Korean movie. Was too captivated by everything that happened in the movie. Pitiful, comical, thrilling and horrifying. It's not simple to understand though. One can interpret in many ways. Anyone shud watch it in a lifetime.","Mar 5, 2020"
10,Extra Ordinary Drama Movie,"Never Expected this kind of Movie...This movie literally contains all elements.... Brilliant Direction,Music,and acting....Must watch movie","Jan 26, 2020"
10,How can this Jewel can be compared to ROMA,"Wow! I can't understand how or why this excellent film can be compared to ROMA. This is pure gold. Roma was bad in a lot of aspects, bad acting, bad rythm, history/screenplay, etc. Even using a great camera such as Alexa 65 was a great disappointment. Now, this film Parasite is in every area a superb film. We need more movies like this!!!","Jan 10, 2020"
10,"A Subtle And Meticulously Scripted Masterpiece In Its Very Calm Portrayal Of Comedy, Corruption And Murder!","This will most likely be in the top 5 list of Korean films for all time. Its an absolute masterpiece of genre subtlety that had me engrossed from the very beginning. It had already been out quite some time before I got to watching it because, I just wasn't drawn to it in any way. It came across as boring to me whilst reading the studio advertisement blurb. Luckily on one of those rainy day moments, not knowing what I fancied watching, I finally opted to watch it; and so pleased I did.

Its a simple story of the existing life of poverty in South Korea (many people are destitute but the government hides it) and, a simple piece of luck that spiraled out of control into a full blown scam. The main 4 antagonists of the story are a deadbeat father, a miserable grumpy mother, a selfish foul mouthed daughter with the in your face attitude that kids have today and finally, a son who is the only decent person in the family and wants to better himself and his lifestyle.

The way the individual actors portray their character roles is of extremely Oscar worthy performances. Everything is carried out in such a calm, peaceful and laid back manner; except for a bit of mayhem, at a garden party, at the closing stages of the film.

Bad Language: YES...and not really necessary for the film... Sex: NO...but some totally unneeded intimate lewd groping scenes... Not a Family film but a superb one for the 16 and over viewers!","Aug 1, 2022"
10,"a treat for the eyes, I didn't have to think too much to give it a 10 ,","You will watch it and you know it has subtleties It talks about how poor and rich ""nice"" people see each other It doesn't bore you for a single minute It is the best this year","Oct 11, 2019"
10,I've never seen a movie more deserving of a 10/10,"Edit: After the Oscars craze, i felt compelled to talk about the ""good, but overrated"" comments that I see more and more. Parasite is the perfect example of contemporary art. It's very easily digestible by the masses, as it is an objectively entertaining movie that even Marvel-DC-audiences can enjoy. However this movie is so layered that you can dig for days and still find hidden meanings and metaphors. They're subtle enough though, that a casual viewer can ignore them without loosing any part of the entertainment aspect. Those who seek an important and complex message can find it, and those who seek a 2-hour entertainment can also find it. Therefore we have the ""good, but overrated"" phenomenon.

I've just recently been introduced to the S.Korean film industry. After a long break from contemporary Hollywood movies, my faith and excitement for cinema has been restored thanks to S.Korean films. I firstly want to talk generally about the differences between big Hollywood blockbusters and what I've experienced with Korean cinema so far. Just for reference, the Korean movies I've seen so far are basically crime/drama/mystery movies with my top 3 being: 1. Parasite, 2. the Chaser, 3. Memories of murder. But there are many that I've yet to watch. What all of those movies have in common is the fact that they are not afraid to be a)real enough to make you relate and feel like you are part of that world, b)funny with respect to the story and the characters, and c) weirdly they felt like they weren't trying too much. I don't know if it's just me being sick of all the Hollywood's ""trying to be super cool"" act, but I find it refreshing to see a movie not talking itself too seriously, but at the same time handling very serious topics without losing the balance of all the above mentioned characteristics. And I find that very hard to do, it really is a thin line. I am so excited to have discovered S.Korean cinema, and i wish more people would not be afraid of the non-Hollywood film industry, as I was.

So, regarding Parasite. If you haven't seen the movie yet, and considering watching it, GO WATCH IT! Don't read anything else. Don't research and ideally don't even watch the trailer. This movie stuck with me for days after watching it. I wish I could forget what I watched and watch it again with a clean slate. What an experience it was! My spoiler-free thoughts: This movie is a master-class in film making and cinematography. All the symbolism and the brilliant shots were so subtle, nothing was thrown in your face. I would almost describe it humble in all its glory. This movie, even if you watch it on mute, has still a story to tell you. Absolutely genius! All praise to director Bong! I don't remember the last time I watched a film and didn't check my phone at all during it. I would say, most films, even the best ones, have some filler shots, meaning they have some kind of low energy points. Parasite had me hooked throughout every single minute of it. In other words, you will not get bored. It's so surprisingly entertaining through all its aspects and genres. Dark comedy, mystery, thriller, drama. They blend so good, and seamlessly that it's almost hard to pay attention to them, because the plot just unravels so naturally that it just seems normal to change the whole mood of the movie. Have you any idea how hard it is to do that, how complicated it is? But somehow Bong managed to make it look easy and natural. When I was a kid, I remember watching the Olympics with my dad. I mostly enjoyed watching the divers. I remember saying to my dad how easy it looked, and how I could probably do it, too (shame on my sweet innocent self, I know). And my dad responded with something that stuck with me: ""Whenever you think that something that somebody is doing looks easy, that is because they are freakishly good at it, and it's actually almost impossible to do by anyone else, and that they have failed and cried and almost gave up probably a million times"". So, respect to the professionals. This movie reminded me of that. Something extremely difficult that seems easy, and effortless.","Nov 18, 2019"
10,Awesome movie!,"I loved this movie so much! The film is interesting, thought provoking, there is drama, comedy and an impressive plot twist. All my friends who watched it liked and so did I. I watched the film in Korean with Brazilian Portuguese subtitles, I think it is important to watch the film in its own language. Song Kang-ho is an excellent actor, I really liked his work. The first film I've watched with him was ""A Taxi Driver"" (2017), another awesome filme about some events of the Gwangju Uprising in 1980. After watching Parasite, I was very inclined and interested in looking for other Bong Joon-ho's films.","Feb 12, 2020"
10,Superb casting and direction,"All the actors were convincing, intense performances by all of them. Great directing, art and photography. Some of the most beautiful shots I have seen , specially considering the places they were showing.","Jan 29, 2020"
10,Spectacular!,"The cinematic excellence of this film is one of a kind. It has such an original approach to its meaning and thought process for each scene. This film is one like no other. The fact that it has subtitles adds to the raw feeling and authenticity of the film. Giving each character a real element. It has so many genuinely intelligent plays, you have to watch it more than once to explore its excellence. The first time you watch it, you will be captured by the emotional and breathtaking journey it takes you on, and then the second time, you will be able to appreciate the brilliance of each mirrored scene, each tactical foreshadow and each hint that as a first time watcher you would be sure to miss. It has an outstanding, in-depth analysis and projection of the upper and lower class separations; each one of these being shown throughout and uniquely. Highly, highly recommended, I will keep this film as one of my greats for a long long time.","Feb 28, 2020"
10,"""Parasite"" is a masterful film.","""Parasite"" is a powerful and perfect film that will leave you in awe with its twisted, funny and tension-filled scenes. Writer/director Bong Joon-ho's approach to social classes creeps up on you like suspense in a Hitchcock film. . In this dramatic thriller with elements of dark comedy, an unemployed family schemes their way into working for a much wealthier family by posing as highly-qualified individuals. . Where to begin on how great of a film ""Parasite"" is? Never has there been a film of this genre to exceed so much and so perfectly. All the performances are incredible, the direction is Joon-ho's finest and most masterful and the story is beyond relevant to all of us. You never know where ""Parasite"" will lead you but when it gets there, it shocks you or it makes you laugh or even both. This film ranks among the best of the decade and definitely one of the best of the year. An absolute must-see.","Dec 4, 2019"

10,Simply amazing,This is my first experience with a Korean movie and I believe that I started with the best. This movie is amazing very simple but yet full of everything and all kinds of feelings the movie starts as a comedy it ends in a very dramatic way that you could never expect and the transition between the two phases was very smooth. The acting is very high level not a bit less than all A-list stars in Hollywood. Everybody must watch this movie.,"Oct 26, 2019"
10,Good Story,"It's very good movie. You must watch this movie once in your life. Movie direction is great, story is amazing, acting cast I think everything is perfect.","Dec 28, 2020"
10,Couldn't have been a better first for the Academy,"This film is always going to be known as the first international (nonEnglish) film to win best picture. I am glad that the Oscars finally honored world cinema and I am especially glad this is a very good movie.

I don't have much to add to what others have said. It is funny social satire, an engaging thriller and heart breaking drama (esp. the last shot of the film) rolled into a story that feels to go everywhere it needs to. I have watched this twice and it is such a engaging story first and foremost. That it also functions as a rebuke of capital makes the film richer but the social themes don't overwhelm it as pure storytelling.

The film has a great vertical aspect to its visual constructions. It has a lot of stairs in the film and the camera is moving up and down a lot during it. It is not overdone but the use of space is really striking. So glad I blind bought this.","Feb 22, 2020"
10,Brilliant,The plot of this film is captivating. The cinematography is simply amazing. I'll be watching this title several times a year.,"Dec 12, 2020"
10,A blistering black comedy,"One of the most horrendously hilarious portrait of any typical family ever committed in cinema in recent memory.

It's narrative had a global relevance seldom seen in cinema these days. It's multi-layered social commentary that still managed to be very Korean all with its profusely embedded cultural and historical references scattered throughout the story which seemingly etched in stone that was gifted to one of the main characters. Metaphorical, literal, it's everything a brilliant story could ever be. Never had I laughed in a cineplex so loud it's almost scandalous, an orgasmic feeling even. But what stands out as phenomenal in this film is the richness of how the characters in the film were all fleshed out, result is very multi-dimensional.

I've seen qute a few of Bong Joon-ho's film works, and I can already say this film is not his finest work but it's grasp over the numerous accolades it has received since its release is very much deserved, and I definitely still want to be surprised with the stories he has already told and are still gonna tell in the future, so I'm very much looking forward to exploring his other works as well, it's just like finding jewel in the rough as they say.

Definitely, an alpha.","Dec 3, 2020"
10,Best Film of the year 👏,"It took me while to be able to sit and review this movie. It has been difficult, almost impossible to put down into words anything about it. I truly lacked the right words and was even afraid not to be true to its core. Here's a film which leaves no one indifferent. It is certainly metaphorical in every aspect: the water that is both a blessing or a catatrophe depending on which side of the social pyramid one stands; the smell inpregnated in old people's clothes which both disgusts and arouses the rich couple; the large window in their house in comparison to the poor family 's basement window. The question starts with a simple title:""Parasite"". Who are they? The ones in the basement, at the bottom of the pyramid? The ones in the middle trying to strive, even if they cannot get rid of the smell? The ones on top of that pyramid who pretend to accept others yet lack total RESPECT? Or aren't WE all parasites somehow and loose perspective so often? Wasn't a camera leading our eyes all the time? For the first time in my life I had a feeling of real movement while watching a film. Sometimes I was moving left, right, up or down. Sometimes I was watching. Others I was being watched. The window could be either a screen to the outside world, inside the house. I often felt watched in the movie theatre Was I the parasite? If this isn't the Best Film of the year, I don't know what it us.👏👏👏","Dec 23, 2019"
10,"Yes, it's really good",Watch this movie. I watched it without knowing anything about it and was happily suprised that I was watching a masterpiece.,"Mar 14, 2020"
10,The best,After seeing this I am not liking any other movie,"Feb 24, 2020"
10,Spectacular movie,"This movie is just smart, entertaining, and artistically fulfilling. If it had only succeeded in one of those three aspects, this would be a very good movie, but instead it just excels at all three.

The script is more than satisfying and highly entertaining. And the way the movie presents its own world and draws you in completely... it is just beautiful.

It is difficult to judge the acting when you don't speak the language, but all interactions look very convincing and in line with the implausibility of this so ridiculous world, yet so similar to ours.

I just wanted to write this review to recommend anyone who's reading to watch this movie. I really enjoyed it and, I will gladly watch it again some time in the future.","Dec 7, 2019"
10,An incredible film which doesn't reduce itself to one genre,"I expected a lot from Parasite (Gisaengchung) since it won the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival and because i really like Bong Joon-Ho's previous films.

Still, it exceeded my expectations. It's a comedy, Drama, Thriller and Horror film in one. Sometimes there are films which you know are going to be liked by people who are film enthusiast, but not by the general movie going public who go to the cinema to be entertained. I think Parasite is going to appeal to both film enthusiasts and the general movie going public.

The cinematography and mise-en-scene are beautiful as it often is in Korean films; the style is very similar to Burning by Lee Chang-Dong. But the story is something else. During the first part of the film it seems like a comedy and makes you laugh, but then after a while the story becomes more and more serious and eventually turns into a thriller/horror. I'm not going to say more about the plot/story than that because i don't want to give anything away and because i think you should go into this film without knowing anything.

This film is simply a must watch!! No wonder it won the Palme d'Or.","Sep 29, 2019"
10,Well deserved the Oscar!,"Really good movie, the story line of the movie was incredible and it floated piece by piece as well.","Feb 22, 2020"
10,It deserves all the praise,"So I finally saw Parasite and after weeks and weeks of hearing about how great this movie is, I didn't think it could possibly live up to all that praise.

Well, it somehow managed to be even better than I anticipated. How the hell did Bong Joon-Ho manage that?!

This is an incredibly tense, darkly funny, beautifully shot and amazingly acted masterpiece and I loved every minute of it.

From now on, I'm staying away from basements","Feb 29, 2020"
10,Cinema Personified: Incredible Movie,"Rating: 9.5 Great Acting, Incredible Direction, Incredible Story, Incredible Screenplay (Both how Comedic it is and how trilling and powerful it is) even though it is in Korean and I was reading subtitles, Score was great in how it complements the movie, Incredible Symbolism in the commentary on Class Conflict, The Movie is broken into two separate parts (A comedic half and a thriller half), The pacing of the movie is very off because it spends too much time on the comedic side when a little bit more should be placed on the second half due to the commentary it is trying to convey, The issue with the pacing leads to the ending/epilogue to be very rushed, Overall Incredible Movie.","Jun 13, 2023"
10,"One of the best, if not the best movie of the year","I was looking forward to this movie all year, since i didn't like Roma (the international film front-runner and winner of 2018) as much as others did. This might just be the best foreign language film I have ever seen, with Portrait of a Lady on Fire (my personal favourite movie of the year) being one of the runner-ups.

This film was a transcendent cinematic experience for me, as Bong Joon Ho, the director of the movie makes it seem like its a walk in the park to go through the different genres in film. Movies are my favorite form of art and Parasite is just that: The Definition of Art. Lets go #Bonghive 🍯","Jan 16, 2020"
10,We're All Parasites..,The title caught me off guard..is it a horror film? Suspense? Not fully knowing what to expect..sets up Parasite perfectly! I was reminded what quality film making and storytelling was about. Each scene layer on top of the next like a fitted-suit. You connected with each character as if you knew them. Plot twists and turns smorgasbord built to a thunderous crescendo. The movie is deep! We're all parasites..using the class above or below. Korea's changing the game.,"Apr 8, 2020"
10,Bong Joon-Ho is a genius!,"Bong Joon-Ho is a director that I'll definitely check out more. I loved Snowpiercer but have left to see the rest of his Korean films which have been unanimously praised by everyone. Parasite is nothing short of genius.

It's best to go in not knowing anything about the movie as that makes the experience all the more enjoyable but what I can say is that Parasite combines many different genres at once which is executed in the best way possible. This film will take you on a rollercoaster of emotions. There are some extremely funny moments then there are moments of tragedy and despair and then there are times which are incredibly intense yet none of it feels inconsistent. Bong Joon-Ho managed to find the perfect blend of funny and serious tones whilst making the film feel as smooth as possible.

The story of Parasite is extremely well thought and manages to stay subtle throughout its entirety. Bong Joon-Ho crafted characters that are really clever and interesting to watch. Their motivations and state make them believable to the audience. The events that unfold don't come across as unrealistic but rather plausible due to the excellent writing.

Aside from the story, this is one of the most beautiful films of 2019. The colours and lighting are really well utilised making the cinematography look downright gorgeous. There is one scene involving a lot of water which looks fantastic. The editing is fantastic as the film's pacing is quite fast so there is no dull moment whatsoever. The aesthetics on the whole is top notch.

I thought Knives Out had a stellar cast but the ensemble cast of Parasite is extraordinary. Everyone did a phenomenal job playing their roles.

I really tried to think of flaws but as of now I could not find any. Everything is addressed properly and what takes place all makes sense. Whilst delivering a fun film, there are some great themes and messages this film explores and Bong Joon-Ho sheds light on them visually rather than using exposition which I commend. I love how he respects the audience by not thinking they're dumb.

2019 has been one of the best years for film and Parasite is one of the best without a doubt. A lot of people have already seen this movie but if you haven't then go watch it immediately. This is a film you should not miss.","Jan 26, 2020"
10,A brilliant piece of art which will slowly grows on you!,Well written and performed also technically shines cinematography & bgm are too good and there's not even a single lag it's perfectly edited. Probably the best experience in recent times. Its pure art resembles the modern society the emotions they had shelved are insanely exceptional a layered masterpiece. If you like dark thrillers then you shouldn't miss Mr. Bong joon-ho's Parasite. Definitely tops the list of best movies in 2019.,"Aug 19, 2019"
10,JUST GO OUT AND WATCH IT,"Usually I dont comment/review the movies I am watching, but this one deserves it. Dont know what to say, just a MASTERPIECE.

Advice: Dont watch the trailer or try to get any information about the movie, just go out and watch it.","Oct 23, 2019"
10,astounding,"Watch it...its a classic and brilliantly done, I watched it 8 times after the first...","Jan 12, 2021"
10,Truly thought-provoking and telling cinema,Not many movies combine entertainment and social commentary in equal measure but this one sure does. There are many layers to the plot; there's the events that you're watching but there's also a deeper layer that you're almost compelled to think about as you watch. Everyone will have a slightly different takeaway of what the filmmakers are trying to say but I think everyone will get something valuable from it. I would recommend 100 percent!,"Feb 3, 2020"
10,A masterpiece,I wasn't expecting something as good as this. Excellent. A modern masterpiece.,"Mar 3, 2021"
10,Brilliant,"Worth multiple rewatches

Love the multiple reviews on the beatiful cinematography, directing and editting.

Should have won more categories at the Oscars","Mar 4, 2020"
10,ONE OF 2019'S BEST...!,"Bong Joon-ho's (Snowpiercer/The Host) latest is coming to local screens w/the Palm D'Or stamp of excellence & it is well deserved. This twisty long con of a film finds a down on their luck family (downtrodden due to their own circumstances or the current economic paradigm in South Korea?) who thanks to a friend of the college aged son gets an opportunity to get a job as tutor for a rich family (the daughter's grades aren't up to snuff, at least according to the overprotective mother) but once he gets his foot in the door he finds he can bring the rest of his disparate clan (his mom, dad & sister) into the mix. His sister comes in as an artistic coach to the well-off youngest son & elaborate schemes are perpetrated to oust the driver & the maid (who worked at the property w/the architect of the manse) so that his parents can fill in those slots. So far so good (depending on whose side you happen to be on since the elite clan is depicted is out of touch & inheritors of the new Korea) but then a genius twist happens which throws the entire plot upside down, forcing our anti-heroes to make a decision which will effect their world. Wonderfully delineated as a lighthearted (at least for the most part) 'me against them' (there's a wonderful sequence where the working family rushes home in the rain & their journey home is literally a descent into hell) which rides the fine line between cruel & mirthful. One of the year's best, catch it!","Dec 9, 2019"
10,Mind blowing,"A true masterpiece, 10/10! I don't think I will get to watch a better movie soon!","Feb 6, 2020"
10,Amazing movie,"Definitely lives up to the hype, so much better than I was expecting","Apr 4, 2020"
10,I have never seen a movie like this!,"It was a wonderful movie, truly! I did not expect that level of acting and the way the movie was shot really stands out. It was, amazingly enough, filled with humor (both dark and stupid humor, the whole room was straight out laughing at some points! ), love, hate and passion in a way that I cannot describe. I jumped and screamed in my seat several times and by the time i left the movie theater my heart was pumping in my chest and I felt like I just had completed a marathon. My head is still spinning from all the plot twist, that I did not see coming! 10/10 would always recommend and hope to see it again soon!","Jan 6, 2020"
10,pretty funny instant classic,It's a more hopeful and ironic Shoplifters. Dope Movie.,"Apr 4, 2020"
10,My First korean film but WOW,"The story The title The acting The theme Wow My first exposure to korean cinema, off course after the wide International acclaim it received. Everything aside this movie deserves evedy bit. To take such a subject and majority of the movie shot in a house with such good acting The director and the whole team stand out","Mar 29, 2020"
10,its not a new idea,"But its an amazing movie to follow from start to end. it has humour, sorrow, genial twists and lures, marvellous acting from the entire cast. the filmography is a marvel itself, and should be seen even though you might not like south korean film.the transitions between scenes are what i call supersmooth, and very well spiced musical score, that makes you relax as well as take your breath away of shock jolts that appears from nowhere.

its a comedy satire, with a whole lot of wishing well realism, a quick look at south korean sosciety, the extreme contrasts , and the serendipidness of life that makes a grumpy old man impressed. its a top notch flick and its highly recommended.","Aug 10, 2019"
10,We're all parasites in some way...,"This definitely deserved an oscar! It's a masterpiece of photography, acting, and script. I can't say what's the gender of this movie...Start as a comedy and exactly in the middle turns to be a thriller/horror (I'm not joking, it's evenly divided). It's a ''cult movie'' with subtle meanings behind the obvious, when I finished I didn't understand all the things in the movie. But after a moment of reflection and see reviews and comments on Youtube, I realize the depth in history, how the social injustices were represented, and why the title is ''parasite''. There's no villain, there aren't the simplistic division between ''bad'' and ''good'' guys, all the people had at least a little bit of parasitism...","Sep 14, 2020"
10,[9.6] Marvelous and destabilizing,"With no idea what that was about, I went through it, laughing my belly out, almost falling from my chair, enjoying it tremendously, being destabilized and shocked with my mouth half-open...

(+) Superb screenplay and story
(+) Superb accompanying music
(+) Amazing and believable acting. One of the best group acting that I've ever seen
(+) Very good and smooth development throughout
(-) Minor unrealistic events toward the end, dissipated in the satirical story and of no real importance


Korean productions have a force and class of their own, being Comedy, Drama or Horror; Most of them shine and they shine deeply.

Highly recommended and deserving the Palme d'Or that it won.","Nov 10, 2020"
10,Best Film of the year,I wouldn't say anything bad about this movie because I can't!,"Nov 21, 2019"
10,the line between class,"Bong Joon Ho has an amazing track record. Memories of Murder, Mother, and the Host are fantastic, Okja was awesome and Snowpiercer is good. He's never made a bad movie and with now seeing Parasite twice, I can say he's still going strong. Moreover this might be his best film or at least competes with it (Memories of Murder is still a considerable contender.) The madman went as far as I say, to making the second best movie of the year, only behind the Lighthouse for me. But for everyone else it's their number one and deservedly so. It's just one of those masterpieces everyone and anyone can enjoy, critic and casual viewer alike. The end strikes with blunt surprise and it was nice to gauge the theaters reaction after knowing what was going to happen. Bongs drama and comedy have always meshed so well together without bringing the tension out the scene but with this movie there's that and this amazing tone shift near the midpoint that fits like a puzzle piece; changing the atmosphere, themes, and style in a way that makes 100% sense. It's like many movies in one. This will be talked about as being a classic of the decade for these reasons because of how perfectly it was done.

Without spoiling too much, this movie is about class. And not in the obnoxious in-your-face way where the poorer characters can do no wrong and there's an obvious message of ""rich bad, poor sad"" but done in the way by subverting those tropes by making the poor flawed but smart and the rich into gullible people. Themes and messages the movie has are very subtle to being said out loud: that being mostly about exploring the ""line"" between class. Whether that be through extremely great writing or literally through the directing and how it's shot. The whole film is like this where a line in the shot separates the two classes. It's done through lines in the wall, one genius moment of a reflection on a window as it's being looked out of, a fridge, or just as simple as panning down like in the beginning to show they're the lowest of the low in a already low shot. How they view the same things such as rain tells a whole lot too. While the rich enjoy its beauty and smell, the poor despise it because it floods the neighborhood and house in a very tense dramatic scene. Another nice touch is where they're located: the poorer family living at the bottom of the hill get the brute end of the storm while the rich on top are unaffected. But how the poor view and react to other fellow poor people in a twist situation was the point where I knew this movie was genius. Rather than live together, they fight, accomplishing nothing but a good time for the audience.

The performances are memorable and witty and not one dimensional, each with a purpose and each one being immensely entertaining in their own way. They all had a time to shine and they did with flying colors. Bongs directing prowess is at an all time high as every frame and movement feels methodically thought out. His gorgeous use of cinematography, seamless editing, and music fits so well and help flesh out the soothing, chaotic, and claustrophobic atmosphere/tone. The set design was also noticeably pleasing as it explores into the themes more. I would give my interpretation on the rock but that would spoil it. I have nothing more to say other than don't read much else about it and go in blind if you can. 10/10","Dec 9, 2019"
10,Parasite,Bong Joon Ho is one of the best and talented Director. Parasite was a great dark comedy movie. It was pretty much realistic movie. I'm not that great to write a review about this movie. Everybody should watch this movie.,"Jun 8, 2020"
10,Awesome Mindblowing,It is an awesome roller coaster ride which you dont want to stop even after the movie ends you want more and more. Perfact combination of stars awesome story something new each and every scene sticks you like a glue. And you got hangover of this movie for days.,"May 4, 2020"
10,Better late than never... Parasite is as brilliant as I've been told. One of 2019's best.,"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)

Yes, I know. I'm late as hell. I don't really have anything to offer you besides my personal opinion. Theses and video essays are breaking down Parasite at such a deep level that I can't really write anything new. Nevertheless, I'll share my thoughts on it because it would be a massive miss from someone who considers himself as a film critic. I had this movie on my watchlist since last summer, but I kept delaying it, underestimating my time. So, no, I'm not just watching Parasite because it won Best Picture at the Oscars, I always planned on it.

In addition to that, yes, I also love it like most people, and no, I'm not writing this because I'm ""following the pack"". Bong Joon Ho simply delivered one of 2019's best films, and it's definitely cracking a spot in my Top10. I really enjoyed what Bong did with Okja, and I'm a massive fan of Snowpiercer. Therefore, this isn't just another South Korean flick. It's directed and co-written by someone who has been proving himself for quite some time. Even though I still defend that Sam Mendes deserved to win Best Director for his work on 1917, I'm more than happy that a foreign movie finally won Best Picture, and what a film to do it!

It can be described as a dark dramedy, but I think social satire is more adequate. The differences between the rich and the poor are beautifully shown on-screen exclusively through visuals. There's so little exposition, which is one of the reasons why Parasite has one of 2019's best screenplays. The balance between explaining something and leaving it ambiguous is perfect. Throughout the runtime, Bong Joon Ho leans on an actor's face so that the audience can understand what that character is feeling through its expressions, which will explain its actions later on.

There's a sequence that surely has been heavily discussed for the past months. It's raining, and Bong cleverly divides the screen with how the wealthy family is dealing with it against the poor neighborhood where the Kim family comes from. The gorgeous cinematography, the unforgettable musical score, the seamless editing... Everything about this sequence is technically flawless, and it carries such an emotionally powerful message. Something astonishing and beautiful to look at for some can be a horrible disaster for others.

It's a movie that balances a lot of tones. In ten minutes, the tone goes from funny to dramatic to suspenseful to scary to absolute tragedy... and it all feels incredibly realistic. That's one of my major compliments to Parasite: I never felt like it was fiction. I never thought ""this is too much, this would never occur"". Even in the third act, where the narrative takes some bold decisions, everything makes sense with what had been shown until then. From shocking character actions to surprising plot points, Bong and Han Jin-won's screenplay is excellent.

Everyone in the cast is fantastic, but Song Kang-ho is the standout, in my opinion. His role as the father of the Kim family is brilliant. I'm actually surprised he wasn't nominated for Best Actor in more award shows. I created a connection with this family in such a way that the ending truly impacted me. It's tough to deny that the writing is what makes Parasite the phenomenon that so many people fell in love with, myself included.

Technically, I don't have any defects to point out. It's one of those films that I firmly believe in having virtually no flaws. I'm in love with the score, I gasped several times at the impressive cinematography, and the editing is perfect. Whatever genre the story decides to go to, it's always entertaining and extremely captivating. Its comedy is very smart, and it made me laugh a lot of times. Its dramatic storylines kept my eyes always focused on what was happening. Even when it briefly delves into the horror territory, it's more suspenseful and scary than most of that genre's flicks nowadays.

All in all, Parasite genuinely surprised me. With so many people hyping it to a ridiculously high level, my expectations were very moderate. Nevertheless, I love it as much or more as everyone else. I know that watching it this late can make some people question my opinion/rating, but I would never love a movie because I ""should"" or because other people do. It deserves every award it received, especially the ones concerning the screenplay. It's one of the best original stories of the last few years, and it's written in such a brilliant manner, with beautiful visual storytelling instead of the overused exposition. An emotionally resonant message is present throughout the whole runtime, and the various tones are balanced seamlessly. Technically flawless: cinematography, score, editing... everything's absolutely perfect. Nothing is placed without purpose. Not a single line of dialogue is wasted. Bong Joon Ho is a phenomenal filmmaker, one that cares about the art and everything that comes with it. He truly put his heart and soul into this, and it would be a shame if anyone fails to watch this magnificent movie just because it's in a foreign language. Please, don't make such an awful mistake...

It has a mixture of different feelings and the musics that were choosen is just perfectly matched.Besides the actors also done great job in acting.

10,Masterpiece,Bong Joon-ho delivers an engaging film that continues to get more engaging by the minute and lives up to and exceeds it's hype. The story goes from funny to thrilling to dark in the 132 minutes of a genius plot.,"Mar 2, 2020"
10,Stunningly original tale of rich and poor,"Bong Joon-ho's masterful film Parasite is a wicked and brutal satire about wealth disparity. The film's setup has a poor family, the Kims, infiltrating the lives of a wealthy family, the Parks, by becoming their new employees. Kim Ki-woo (Woo-sik Choi) is legitimately a tutor for the Parks' daughter Da-hye (Jung Ziso), but he uses his standing to then usher in his sister Ki-jung (So-dam Park), who poses as an art tutor for the Parks' young son, Da-song (Hyun-jun Jung). The Kim kids then frame the Parks' driver for being a creep, which allows them to bring in their own father, Ki-taek (Kang-ho Sang), for the job. Finally, the family gets rid of the Parks' housekeeper, Moon-gwang (Jeong-eun Lee), by making her seem sickly due to a peach allergy, which paves the way for the Kims' mother, Chung-sook (Hye-jin Jang), to get the gig. The Parks don't learn that the Kims are related, and everything seems to be going fine until they learn that Moon-gwang has been hiding her husband, Geun-se (Myeong-hoon Park), in the Parks' basement.

What makes the twist in ""Parasite"" so great is that it's as predictable as it is impossible to see coming. The basement in question is featured only twice in the film for less than a minute before its actual role is revealed. But it's a twist that doesn't feel out of question, as we've seen it happen already, just through the eyes of another family.

What makes ""Parasite"" so perfect is that it understands the rules and power of storytelling. Everything on screen has a specific purpose and a meaning that transforms the story as it unpacks. And it's ironic that, as brilliant as Bong's plan for the story is, the genius of ""Parasite"" lies in the 10-minute sequence where an entire plan is demolished on sight.","May 10, 2020"

10,it shows life and some important facts,This movie lives in this time An amazing sweet thriller movie. Great in every single part of the seventh art especially in dialogues which are great no formality in them. Characters talk like ordinary people act like ordinary people they feel happiness they lose temper they succeed and they fail. And after all of these for converting a good movie to a great one you need to be in front of audience I mean the movie should conflict the audience mind and show them some facts. In this case facts are some of the most important ones in our modern life they are about class distinctions which is the difference between rich people and poor people that is getting larger every day and it is the greatest problem in my society finally when you finish watching this masterpiece ask yourself who is the real parasite?

If you're planning to watch this movie avoid spoilers at all costs. It will have you conflicted on who you are rooting for. Parasite taps into the tensions caused by the widening gap between the rich and poor around the world. It's a darkly, entertaining and suspenseful look at a poor but incredibly cunning family and the rich Park family, their polar opposites. The film makes you play a guessing game on which of the two families are more rotten. Parasite shows the extent to which we go to in order to live a comfortable life. It's best to go into the movie not knowing too much about what you're about to see, and let it's sly power sneak up on you. Who are the real parasites? The poor who attach themselves to the rich or the rich that suck the marrow of the poor.","Feb 6, 2020"

It really is THAT good. Not ""good"" its Excellent. Brilliant. Genius. I could go on and on. From the masterful direction to the cinematography and production design, the acting, the script; its all perfect.

10/10 💸

""Such immense effort put into a film about the high and low class, Parasite is as surprising as it is a nail biter that keeps you guessing until the very end.""

The struggle of money is a huge and impactful aspect of the everyday lives us human beings go through everyday. No matter the case, desperation is imminent and dire actions come into play. Parasite does away with telling a tale of class, greed and the values or family. Director Bong Joo-ho, who brought you The Host and Snowpiercer, creates a layered masterpiece that keeps you on edge every second due to the flawless writing and acting within acting (if you watch you'll understand) that keeps Parasite from ever falling under. Even the score and cinematography assist the film in being anxiety inducing. Although it is considered a crime/comedy, I found Parasite to be a scary type of film. Think about it, manipulation can occur at the hand of anyone that remotely tries it, no matter how witty and/or smart the victim is. The horrors of reality stand and it is never too safe to be alert of the occurrences that surround you. Getting to the ending, which I will discuss briefly without giving anything away, is the kind of ending that provokes nervous laughter at the hand of suddenness and sensibility. It's one of those endings that involve so much, but that much just happens to work so well in the film's favor. It's haunting, it's daunting and serves the purpose of leaving a mark.

Verdict: Parasite is one of a kind and is easily one of the best films of the year. There's nothing to not like about this and it'll sure stay with you after the first viewing.","Nov 10, 2019"

Just watch this with your own eyes. I can bet you will never forget this. I have never seen a film where one can present the deeply rooted social class boundaries not just in Asian countries but all over the world in such an entertaining and engaging way.

10,The nuance of classism captured on film,"In our current era of film, it is commonplace to take a moral stance. Whether that stance is on human struggles, political processes, or social conditioning, the stance prevails, and we as the audience have to make our decision while we watch the film on whether or not we agree with the points being brought to us. Films like Elysium, Little Women, 1917, these all wear their moral stance on their sleeve.

Parasite does it differently. The film opens in a way that makes you think the morality of the film will be open and obvious for you, so that you don't have to think too hard about the minutia to feel confident in your morals while watching it. You think you know who to root for, and who is the ""bad guy"".

As you keep watching, Parasite continually pushes your sense of morals, prodding you with the question ""how far is too far?"" and ""how bad is too bad?"". These questions never give you a break, never give you time to come to terms with your answer as Bong Joon Ho continually ramps up the tension until you feel as though your heart will stop in it's tracks.

Parasite poses a moral stance with great nuance and care.","Jan 13, 2020"

10,Parasite: A Must-See Film That Will Keep You Guessing Until the Very End,"Parasite is a South Korean film directed by Bong Joon-ho that tells the story of the impoverished Kim family, who are struggling to make ends meet in a society marked by economic inequality. The film follows the family as they become involved in the lives of the wealthy Park family, ultimately leading to a series of unexpected and explosive events.

One of the standout features of Parasite is its brilliant storytelling. Bong Joon-ho masterfully weaves together a complex and multi-layered narrative that keeps the audience on the edge of their seats. The film is full of twists and turns, and just when you think you have it all figured out, something unexpected happens. The pacing is perfect, with just the right balance of tension and humor, and the characters are well-developed and believable.

The acting in Parasite is top-notch, with standout performances from the entire cast. Song Kang-ho, who plays the head of the Kim family, is particularly impressive, conveying a wide range of emotions with subtlety and nuance. The cinematography is also excellent, with beautiful shots that perfectly capture the mood and tone of the film.

Overall, Parasite is a masterful film that is not to be missed. It is a poignant commentary on social inequality and the human condition, and it is also a thrilling and entertaining ride. Highly recommended.","Jan 5, 2023"
10,"Richly deserved Best Picture Award, superb social comment","Director Bong Joon Ho directed, wrote the screenplay and produced PARASITES. He deserved all the four Oscars that his film and he collected. There is something Tarantino-like about his style, in the way that he presents intersecting individuals from different social strata with apparently comic but definitely violent ultimate consequences. However, he is more polished than Tarantino was at the same age, and stage in his career.

He presents reality without judging: the Kims are a family of jobless and largely useless individuals who do not even know how to fold pizza boxes properly, who have no money for Wi-Fi, and find it only in a toilet in the strangest place in a house that I've ever seen.

The father - superbly played by Kang-ho Song - claims to have a plan but ultimately admits that the sole plan that won't fail is no plan. He tries to adapat to situations and is quick to react to any opportunity.

The mother is admirably played by Hye-jin Jang, a courageous and resilient fighter in the face of life's adversities, and a fantastic imitator of North Korean leaders' speech delivery styles.

Sun Kyun-Lee plays the son, a likeable young man who forges a university degree and copies a more successful friend's example, which will ultimately weigh him down like the rock that the friend gives him.

His sister, the extremely beautiful So-dam Park, is the most level-headed and intelligent of the lot, a quick thinker who has a touch for children,

The son finds a job as a teacher of English in a rich home run by a father who is often away on business in Paris, and a completely useless but physically gorgeous Yeo-jeong Jo (lovely legs!)

By first pulling in his sister to placate and teach painting to the bolshy child in the rich family, and then finding jobs in the household for his father and mother, the son gets the family's foot in the door to a world of wealth such as they had never imagined, and which they rapidly start wishing they could occupy. Needless to say, that can only be achieved with violence, and violence does indeed beget violence, but there are surprises along the way.

Acting is of the highest standard by all, but I would like to single out Jeong-eun Lee as the governess who is allergic to peaches, who keeps her husband hidden in the rich house's basement. The sequences where she rings the bell during the torrential rain, and where she tries to open the passage to the basement are unique and memorable.

Cinematography is immaculate, with memorable sequences like the flood in the poorer sections of town -- in contrast with the safety in the higher grounds occupied by the rich; the scramble for the cell phone before a video can be sent from it; and the overhead shot of Kang-ho Song running into hiding after stabbing the rich homeowner.

Credible and gripping screenplay, fantastic action sequences. Completely deserved Best Picture Academy Award.","Feb 15, 2020"
10,Astonishing!,"Easily one of the best movies I've ever seen! ""You've never seen a movie quite like X."" Such a statement has become overused to such a degree that it's impossible to be taken seriously, like how too many major new movies are gifted the m-word: masterpiece. So how do critics convey when a film truly is unexpectedly, brilliantly unpredictable in ways that feel revelatory? And what do we do when we see an actual ""masterpiece"" in this era of critics crying wolf? Especially one with so many twists and turns that the best writing about it will be long after spoiler warnings aren't needed? I'll do my best because Bong Joon-ho's ""Parasite"" is unquestionably one of the best films of the year. Just trust me on this one.","Apr 7, 2022"
10,Masterprice,"Parasite is a masterpiece. You can find reality, critic to the society, well measured conversations and moments, thriller, terror, comedy...

10,Exceptional,"This is the first and only movie I've felt compelled to write a review for.

Admittedly, I rarely watch foreign language films because of having to read subtitles, but I made a point this year of watching every Oscar-nominated film I could. I had absolutely no idea what to expect going into it, and I think that's what made the film so compelling. Absolutely exceptional acting, beautiful cinematography, moving symbolism and pertinent social commentary. I could never predict what would happen next in the plot, and just when you think it should go one way, it does a 180 and goes a completely unexpected direction.

Go into it knowing as little as possible about it. It's so much better that way. You won't regret it.","Feb 15, 2020"
10,BRILLIANT,"This movie is a perfect example of the homeless crisis in Korea. While it does show the differences of the lives of the poor and the rich, it doesn't turn out how you would think. I walked into this movie thinking it would show how greedy rich people are, but boy was I wrong. This is really a unique survival movie, but not the type where a plane crashes or a man falls while cliff climbing. This is a survival movie of how our society can be evil instead of a particular group of people, and how hard it can be for the poor to survive in modern day society in some locations. I am not going to spoil it, but it really changes half way through with genius directing, cinematography, and music.

10/10 movie, believe the hype.","Feb 4, 2022"

10,A NEW MASTERPIECE,"Bong Joon Ho's absolutely brilliant and powerful masterpiece is a sheer work of cinematic art. It tells the twisted, funny, and ultimately tragic tale of class discrimination and greed. About an dirt-poor Korean family that lives in cramped half basement level apartment where drunks regularly piss and throw-up outside their window. The out of work father Kim Ki-Taek, played terrifically by Song Kang Ho, helps his wife Chung Sook, well played by Jang Hye Jin, and his two children, son Ki-Woo and daughter Ki-Jeong, superbly played by Chi Woo Shik and Park So Dam, fold food boxes for a pitiful low-wage, but that all is about to change and a sinister plan is about to come into play, when Ki-Woo with the assistance of of his sister who creates a fraudulent diploma which helps him secure a job as an English tutor for the teenage daughter of the super wealthy Mr. Park and his naive wife, Yeon-kyo, marvelously played by Lee Sun Kyun and Cho Yeo Jeong. Miss Kim is so impressed by Ki-Woo's teaching skills that she mentions to him that her younger son needs a tutor to improve his art skills, so Ki-Woo recommends an art tutor which unbeknownst to her is his sister Ki-Jeong. What follows is the escalation of the Kim family's nefarious scam as they slowly make the Park family replace their household servants, beginning with their chauffeur, who is replaced by K-Woo's father, then they replace their live-in housekeeper, with Ki-Woo's mother. The Kims have now thoroughly invaded and occupied the Park's home without them suspecting anything, but this insidious situation will soon turn dangerous and deadly in a truly shocking climax. This amazing film is a slow burn in the beginning as the story unfolds but once the Kims are in the Park's home the film becomes an engrossing and breathtaking dark drama with some wicked humor. Masterful Oscar nominated direction by Bong Joon Ho who was first Korean filmmaker to win the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival. Gorgeous cinematography by Kyung-pyo Hong, and a captivating Oscar nominated Original Screenplay by Bong Joon Ho and Jin Won Han, impressive Oscar nominated Production Design by Ha-jun Lee and Won-Woo cho. A new classic that is nominated for 6 Academy Awards including Best Picture. In Korean with English subtitles.","Feb 9, 2020"
10,"A genius insight into class division, executed perfectly. An immediate all time great film.","The best film of the year, maybe the best film of the decade. Just one of the best films in general. Joon-ho Bong balances a social thriller, satire and drama, perfectly and effortlessly. The cinematography is as good as I've ever seen in a film; the editing keeps it highly engaging; the production design adds the impactful disparity between the classes; the score and sound design adds significant character and emotion to each scene; and the performances are powerfully executed from the whole cast. Parasite deserves all the high praise it is receiving from critics and somehow, it deserves more.","Nov 23, 2019"

10,Overrated ? I do not think so at all !!,"Funny, absorbing, dark,and an original screenplay I loved this film. At just over two hours in length it never felt that long at all, and the subtitles the film obviously carries being a Korean production have never bothered me as much as dubbing has done for me in the past as they just do not capture the movie the way it should !! hearing the original language is far better in my opinion.The direction and the cast were superb and as for the beautiful house its mainly filmed in is just so perfect I want to live there now. The film deserves the accolades it rightly as been getting,and Is a worthy best picture Oscar winner for me.","Jun 3, 2020"

It is shame that I had to watch it online because they aren't showing it in my cinema.,"Aug 24, 2019"
10,A masterpiece,"Parasite deserves all the praise and awards it has received and more. It is really refreshing to see a truly deserving movie receive this kind of feedback. The director Bong Joon Ho had already revealed himself with his previous works as an extraordinary artist and one of the excellences of South Korea, which is a truly capable market in terms of filmmaking.

While I recognise that nothing is perfect, the flaws in this movie are really hard to find. Every element of the movie is well thought out and detailed, and you can see that it was made by someone with great love and respect for this art. Direction, acting, editing, and screenplay are flawless, and the message comes through powerfully and well constructed. I do not think it is excessive to call Parasite one of the masterpieces of the recent years. There is not much to add except how the director has really given us a gift with this gem.","Sep 28, 2022"
10,"Thank you, Bong Joon-ho for this tour de force masterpiece!!!!","PARASITE Directed by Bong Joon-Ho How often does one get the opportunity to see a film, on the silver screen, which leaves you enriched by the immaculate craft of the filmmaker's original voice and style of storytelling? How often does a movie leave you inspired to just grab a stack of paper and a pen, and begin writing your very own story? Bong Joon-Ho's Parasite is definitely one of those movies which left me moved and inspired. It's one of those movies which beautifully broadened my view towards the world. This film tackles social issues in a visually visceral and cinematic manner; it doesn't rely on preachy monologues and melodramatic action to convey its underlying themes of class discrimination, greed, family, and morality. Bong Joon-Ho and his writer, Han Jin-won, craft the screenplay in a subtle style in order to convey the social issues that are revolving around the film. Parasite tells the story of the Kim family, which is made of four individuals: a father, a mother, a teenage boy, and a teenage girl. This family takes interest in the Park family, who are incredibly rich and wealthy, when the teenage boy, played exceptionally by Choi Woo-shik, takes over his friend's job as an English tutor for the daughter of the Park family, who is a sophomore in high school. The film proceeds with the Kim family obtaining the various jobs around the house of the Park family, who are unaware of this. From there one, Bong Joon-Ho and his writer, Han Jin-won, tell a beautiful story of family, class discrimination, empathy, and morality in a satirical and dark manner. Parasite embodies a countless number of flawless moments of storytelling, which can leave one entertained, thrilled, and moved. Bong Joon-Ho utilizes visual storytelling to not only heighten the thrills, but using minute details to depict the discriminations that are made between the rich and the poor. There are two scenes which depict the way the rich and the poor perceive heavy rainfalls. The Park family are enamored by the sight and scenery of the rain from their window. Whereas the Kim family, struggle to grab their personal belongings due to their basement apartment being flooded by the rainfall. Yang Jin-mo's editing immerses the viewer in these visually engaging scenes. There is one moment where she uses the shot of the overflowing water transitioning to a bird-eye shot of the Kim family and their neighbors struggling to take the water out of their homes by using buckets. This is what makes Parasite shine as this visual experience, where we as an audience, understand both sides of the coin. The audience is able to grasp a sense of the struggles that the poor have to face, and this is done with incredible cinematography by Hong Kyung-pyo. The performances of Parasite are incredible. Each actor provides a nuanced and authentic performance; they faithfully portray the psychology of their characters. Another incredibly refreshing aspect of this film was how Bong Joon-ho and his writer, Han Jin-won, portray the Park family. They aren't portrayed as stingy rich people, they are kind, caring, and naïve. They are naïve to the point where they are baffled by the smell of a poor individual. Bong Joon-ho authentically depicts the humanity of both the wealthy and impoverished characters of the film. The way the characters are crafted and portrayed is what allows the film to augment Bong Joon-ho's original voice as a storyteller. Parasite is not only the best film I have seen this year; it is the best film I have seen this decade. Thank you, Bong Joon-ho for crafting a tour de force of a film. Thank you for reassuring me, as an aspiring storyteller, that stories build bridges of unity. Thank you of inspiring me to write a story that is original and deeply resonates with my memory and my heart. As the great Japanese filmmaker, Akira Kurosawa once said, ""If you genuinely want to make movies, start writing screenplays. Take a lot of paper and a pen, and just write, write, and write."" Bong Joon-ho's masterpiece, Parasite, inspired me to go home and take a lot of paper and a pen, and just write the stories I want to tell. Thank you, Bong Joon-ho for shrewdly crafting a masterpiece that beautifully depicts the themes of class discrimination and filiality.","Nov 9, 2019"

10,The art of the uncomfortable..,"The art of the uncomfortable.. When words and images are not enough to articulate the feel.. 'Parasite' is one such powerful, subtle, sublime, sinister (brother.basement.scholar rock) social satire on the class conflict, social inequality, underbelly of capitalism, superficial niceties and the hidden apathy & empathy that this world holds or may be it was always like this.. One hell of a climax and the thought, the question that follows 'why the ending was like this'? One has to reflect to understand the comedy of ever sinful poverty, appropriation of cultures, shotput, medal, the disgusting flooding, the housekeeper, respect, forgery artist and the simpleton brother laughing.. A little more realization and there you find the ghost, the lights switching on and off, obliviously acting master, the smell of poverty and anchor of the story 'The Morse code' with its knowledge to interchangeable parasite(s) and the host(s)..

Every single performance is brilliant, from Kang-ho Song, Woo-sik Choi, So-dam Park and Hye-jin Jang as the Kims to Sun-kyun Lee and Yeo-jeung Jo as the parents of the Parks to everyone in between.

In fact, there isn't a single area that the film falters in. Production design, editing, score, cinematography; they are all top class. The script by Bong Joon-ho and Jin Won Han is superb, covering a spectrum from dark comedy to social commentary. The direction by Bong is absolutely brilliant too.

However, my absolute favourite thing about the film is the seamless tonal shifts. The film covers most genres that you could think of; from comedy and drama to thriller and even horror and it does all of this without feeling out of place for a second. Some of the tensest scenes I've seen in a film are contained here and they are utterly brilliant. No matter your interpretation, there's a clear message here, from an examination of money (or lack of) and beyond. The movie is spectacular and will undoubtedly go down as a classic.","Feb 26, 2020"
10,Parasite is a masterpiece,"WOW

If you see this one movie this year, make sure it's Parasite.

I will remember this movie for a long time. So funny yet so dark towards the end of this excellent film. Bong Joon Ho deserves every award he has one for this absolute gem. Please see this movie!","Feb 20, 2020"
10,"Simply put ""Brilliant""","I don't review movies on IMDB but when I do they are mostly for the exceptional ones in my opinion. That said, there is a notion that Oscar winning movies are overhyped and though I feel there's some truth to that....this movie is an outlier! This movie deserved the ""Best Picture"" award.

On a side note, name a genre and this movie covers it comedy, thriller, drama, dark comedy, empathy. Hats off to the actors, producers and the director!","May 12, 2020"
10,Entertainment at it's best,"I know a lot of people have skipped this..... because nobody wants to read subtitles for 2 hours. I hope you are reading this.... And I hope that you can shake off your earlier reservations.... Please watch this.... Movies like this are very rarely made nowadays. Doesn't matter what genre a person likes.....this has it all.... Comedy, Love, Family, Thriller, Crime, Horror. What an awesome movie !!!!","Jan 19, 2020"
10,RESPECT,Loved this Film from Start to End! The Parks n Kim's playing the role of Rich & Poor perfectly. Great Cast! Loved the role of up and down shots n those stairs!!! Best Film of 2019 easily,"Feb 17, 2020"

10,A commedy/horror/thriller Makjang !!!,Best movie of 2019. I am in awe. In fact it's one the best movies i have ever seen in my life.

Wow and it begs the question who is the victim here?,"Aug 24, 2019"
10,Amazing piece of art,"Now THAT's how you make a movie! Kudos to the writer/director, cast and crew for making such a neo-classic work of art! If this movie doesn't win some Oscars, it'll be a crime against humanity!","Jan 29, 2020"
10,WOW,One of the greatest screenplays I have ever seen wow just wow.,"Jul 16, 2020"
10,A movie that stays in your head for weeks and weeks.,"I've never seen a movie do all the things that Parasite does and manage to do them so well. It's a comedy, thriller, horror, and heist film rolled into one, meticulously directed and beautifully edited. It remains entertaining while dealing with heavy topics on the nature of class and wealth. While the movie takes some unexpected turns in tone, it never feels disjointed. Most importantly, Bong Joon-Ho has a way of relaying his social criticism in a nuanced manner, so that the theme of wealth disparity doesn't devolve simply into the poor vs. the wealthy narrative we see often in these types of dramas. Rather, he layers multiple shades of gray into the morality of characters, giving them humanity and therefore a stronger verisimilitude to real people in current society. It makes the movie's appeal universal.

After watching the movie I was floored. It was the only thing I could think about for hours afterwards. Even now I keep discovering another layer of interpretation behind a dialogue or scene. And there is a lot to engage with when the film direction is so detailed. Each shot and each line of dialogue is a result of careful storyboarding and writing. Even the background details such as the brick walls and the litter by the Kims' basement are painstakingly styled and arranged by the set designers. And the result, at least in my summation, is a near perfect execution of a great film.","Feb 21, 2020"
10,Fantastic,Honestly this movie is definitely one that lived up to the hype and deserved every single accolade and award. if you can watch a movie without staring at your phone for the majority of the film in this day and age it's definitely because the movie is capturing .. it had me hooked for 2 hours without being distracted,"Jan 18, 2021"
10,Gang Society Time,"I haven't watched many international films, mostly because I haven't been met with the opportunity of the will to actually go through with the commitment with finding the perfect film and taking my time to sustain it enough. But after hearing all the great reception of this movie I couldn't help but be intrigued enough to search for this movie. I was so happy when I saw it was playing in my local theatre, I rushed to go watch it with as little knowledge of the plot as possible, with the exception of the very vague trailer. And I'm glad the trailer I was shown was interesting enough to get my ass off to watch it but also vague enough to keep me at the edge of my seat the entire time I was watching it. This movie is simply amazing. You see this movie and you immediately feel and think ""masterpiece"". It is funny, dramatic, thrilling, scary, thought provoking, intriguing, depressing, it is everything one can expect from a movie. This premise kept taking many twists and turns I was never confused. The beginning was slow but I was never bored. The jokes land delightfully especially since it had to be translated from Korean. I couldn't believe a movie like this could actually exist until the last 20 minutes I was snapped back to reality and realized ""OH RIGHT THIS IS HAPPENING NOW"" I have nothing against movies in other languages and from other cultures but I honestly didn't think I was gonna be left this impressed. I feel terrible that I had been missing out on such phenomenal works of art. I will mostly definitely try to seek out more of this director's work. If this doesn't win Best Picture I will cry.","Feb 9, 2020"
10,Best of 2019!,"Parasite came along just when I thought I'd seen the best 2019 had to offer. The movie progressed elegantly like an amazing musical piece.

The depth of the characters and the story kept me glued to my seat hoping the credits wouldn't roll. And when the credits did roll, I stared at the black screen in a moment of contemplation, thinking, this is what cinema should be. Absolutely recommend this to anyone who hasn't seen it. 10/10","Nov 21, 2019"

10,Perfectly Everything!,"This is the first movie that can take me places, from comedy to drama to romance to action to thriller to horror to all the combination that grips me speechless at the end of it. I watched it three times and it feels as great every time. Camera works are very structured, scenes are orchestrated almost mathematically they fill my heart so right. Acting is evenly of quality, no one outshines anyone else. Superb!","Feb 16, 2020"
10,Here again- After BEST PICTURE,"This movie reminds me of Life is Beautiful in its life hacks very subtly written, amazing comedia I am sure it will win Best Foreign Picture at the Oscars And it deserves more than this Best Korean movie ever made! ----------

I went crazy when it won, it's masterpiece that will stay forever, and Bong Joon Ho will be a Korean idol","Nov 24, 2019"
10,One of 2019's best.,"Parasite (noun) - a person who habitually relies on or exploits others and gives nothing in return.

10,I loved it. LOVED LOVED loved it,"I loved it. LOVED LOVED loved it. Wow just wow. Everything in this movie is just so damn captivating. Parasite was directed Bong Joon Ho and man....you sir...take a god damn bow. This movie is a gosh darn masterpiece. It will make you laugh, cry, get scared, have chills, etc. name any genre and it is all in one. That's why I love it so much it all the genres of any movie and it is in this film just as one. The cast were phenomenal and fantastic. I didn't get to see this in theaters.... and boy does that suck. I loved it so much 2019 had the best movies I have ever seen such as Joker and 1917.

10,Politico-social commentary does not get any better!!!,"What can one not love about this movie...the movie operates at so many layers of metaphors and ironies...the best that has come out of South Korea till date...expect some fireworks this Oscar season...#Bonghive

the movie basically portrays class divide in South Korea and symbiotic relationship between a rich and a poor family...the rich family is the proverbial host whereas the poor family...the Parasite!!!

The beauty of the movie lies a few layers beneath what is actually portrayed...how the parasite slowly befriends the host...and how it gradually morphs into something else completely...think of all the plot twists and their manifestations in society...specifically the relationship between the owner and the working class...just brings out global sentiments of Capitalism going crazy so beautifully!!!

As this movie is being released globally...I am sure the rankings and ratings will further improve...it was released in India around 1st Feb...this movie is a global phenomena considering the times we live in...Recommended...just go and watch this in your nearest theatre!!!","Feb 3, 2020"
10,BEST MOVIE OF 2019,"Lot of comments on how this movie is mediocre and overrated I'm sure those people have rated starwars and avengers 10 on10. If you have watched some good old Korean movies such as bediveled, old boy, yellow sea and memories of murder you know this movie stands on equal footing with those movie I've watched joker Fordvs Ferrari Jojo rabbit 1917 Marriage story

Parasite beats all these movies by a huge difference.","Jan 22, 2020"
10,CREATE a new word to describe the movie!,"It's just Fantastically Fabulous Masterpiece shown in the most creative way as possible..The content is so unique, never seen before..so creative, suspenseful ...Hats off to the makers, they're at the best of movie work!! People need to watch this!!!!","Dec 9, 2019"
10,Every film lover needs to see this at least once or twice,"Director Bong Joon-ho, the wildly innovative foreign director behind ""Snowpiercer"" and ""Okja"" has outdone himself with ""Parasite""- An original and profound look at class warfare that among many things is meticulously crafted, seamlessly blends drama and dark humor with several of the best performances I've seen all year.

If you can get past that this isn't spoken in English, fellow film fans will be in for a real treat come awards season (or whenever it comes to streaming, because missing this would be a crime).

This may just be favorite movie of the year, depending on after I see ""The Irishman"". Review for that coming soon!

10,An Original Work of Art,"Yesterday, at around the beginning of the third act, I 'came to' and realized that this film had hooked my complete attention; then, at the roll of the credits, I had so many thoughts that were provoked by nearly every shot of this movie-laughing and awe-struck by what I'd just experienced. It had been a long time since a movie had given this effect, and it's original films like this that come out of nowhere every once-in-awhile. And today, I know for sure I have to write down my thoughts about this new surprise hidden gem, Parasite, because it truly deserves to be called a masterpiece. This is my first, and most definitely not my last, foreign film to make this list of the greatest. I'm so thrilled that I was motivated to go see this as it has pushed my boundaries of what I thought makes a movie great. Bong Joon Ho has delivered a flawless comical satire that focuses on real issues of the divisions of social classes that are present in every society-so it is not just relatable to Koreans. The genres that can be attached to the movie are numerous since it has bits of comedy, drama, suspense and even thriller aspects that all perfectly interweave together to hold your focus until the very end. It is both moving and thought-provoking, but is also a movie I'd recommend to anyone at any age or stage in their life. It is an all-around masterful original piece of cinema which makes for a very fun time at the movies. Adding to the greatness of the film is the performances from the entire cast. A great ensemble of talented actors-including Ho's long time collaborator Kang-ho Song-make watching every character on screen a moment not to miss. When there is so much chemistry within an on-screen family, you know that the acting is superb to a point at which you forget you are watching a fictional story. You just sympathize with each character because you understand how their actions are driven. Intertextuality is big in this film and makes a second viewing necessary and welcomed. I could watch this movie over and over and find many more hidden aspects that further prove how much thought and time went into crafting it. Bong Joon Ho has my pick for directing and this film for best foreign, possibly best overall. Inspiring to both film enthusiasts and to the everyday human being-this one is very monumental to foreign cinema since it leaves you having a different perspective on the industry. It warns us not to overlook nor disregard a movie simply because we don't like reading subtitles. -TE (11.10.19)","Feb 7, 2020"
10,Parasite!!!,"With Parasite, director Bong Joon-Ho creates an fantastic piece of cinema, that never lost my attention once. This movie makes your think it is going to be one thing and then it becomes something totally new. It's fresh, it's clever, it's shocking and it's satisfying. There is a scene in this movie that concludes the first act in a way that can only be compared to watching a Tetris game where every piece falls into its perfect place one after the other. Around the middle point something is revealed to the Audience that totally changes the path the movie was going on and from there it's an unrelenting roller coaster ride. Bong Joon-Ho also writes some fantastic characters, each of them getting their own perfect moments to shine. Not one character seemed out of place or without reason. They all had their place and brought different layers to the story through their actions and ideas. The actors of course help in bring this characters to life amazingly and the entire cast kills it to the maximum degree! Parasite is a film wonder and must be seen by all.","Jan 22, 2020"
10,A real surprise.,"Honestly I was reluctant to watch this movie for a long time. Because I felt Joker should have cleaned up at the Oscars. But after seeing this I fully understand the academy's decision. What a masterpiece of storytelling. It simply has every ingredient a perfect movie needs. Excitement, laughter and crying it's all in there.","Apr 1, 2020"

10,Brilliant,Never seen a movie like this before. It was brilliant.,"May 8, 2020"
10,A symbolic clash of classes,"An intricate depiction of the society classes forming in every modern society around the world. Rightfully asking the question: ""Who is living of whom?"" It is filled to the brim with metaphors examining the cultural clashes between two very different families from vastly different social standings, headlined by a very strong script and fleshed out characters. Furthermore, it has amazing cinematography with some creative editing choices, great sets and the shot selections are flawless.","Oct 11, 2019"
10,10,"This is just a pure masterpiece. You can see movies like this one only once in couple years. It was intense, interesting plot, amazing actors. Everyone was telling me like first half was OK, but second was boring so film is just Meh. How dare you? If you're basic person who loves only MARVEL or DC films of course this movie is not for you, but if you want to see something more deeper than that pick this one you won't regret. Totally recommended, my favourite movie of 2019.","Mar 27, 2020"
10,AMAZING,"An Incredible film with great cinematography and great acting. A true masterpiece with a funny yet heartbreaking story, and a well deserved best picture winner.","Mar 21, 2021"
10,A film that manages to interrogate the choices every class makes while delivering a roller coaster of emotions for the audience,"I will just say this first. If you are planning to watch this film, stop right here and watch it now before reading anything regarding this film because trust me you want to watch this without knowing anything not even the synonyms.

Now, directed by Joon-ho Bong who also directed Memories of Murder and Snowpiercer, Parasite is a dark comedy thriller which mixes various other genre. Its really hard to describe this film. I would compare this with Quentin Taratino films like the title suggests. But even then this film has a lot of direct message to audience and themes which is very easy to notice. That aside Joon-ho Bong has also upped his game in terms of the structure and storytelling. So much so that at first viewing you won't notice the hidden details and metaphors this film presents. The name ""parasite"" is just one of them. At the end you will be thinking who the real parasites are. Is it the rich, the poor, their expendable need for a better living or the house itself? Acting wise I dint see a single false note by any actors. The main standout was of course the father played brilliantly by Kang-ho Song. Writing is however what makes this film so great. You can see when the director wrote this film he thought of everything. There is not a single loop hole. Every character choices make sense, everything falls into place even when it seems to bizarre yet it seems so completely realistic just because just how we got to that point.

There is so much this film tries to say and you can see the director succeeded it gloriously when you think about it. The social structure with the way we live, our understanding and psychology at looking at people who live differently, our priorities and what we value. Joon-Ho Bong makes sure viewers will think after each act is completed and make your own judgement of what happened. He has completely turned a genre on its head. A film about social class has never been made like this before.

Still, this film may not please to people who just want a happy ending feel good movie. Without spoiling anything till now I will say that the first half is completely different to the second half. If you are the type of person who can handle violence and shock in a film then I will recommend this for you. If you are the person who want something different and original other than what hollywood keeps throwing these days I will recommend this for you. If you think film are not just for entertainment but for the art itself I will recommend this for you. Film industry need to keep investing on visionary directors like Bong Zoon-Ho and you might just get a masterpiece like this once in a while.","Sep 18, 2019"
10,Great Movie!!,"I was wondering about whether or not to watch this movie. Not a fan of Asian movies ... but I started watching it and within 2 minutes I was completely fascinated with it !! the purest Tarantino & Almodovar style... cast, script, dialogues, etc... you don't know if laugh or cry !!","Apr 12, 2020"
10,Bong Joon-Ho's Masterpiece,"Bong Joon-Ho is a filmmaker whose work I've admired since I saw Snowpiercer (2013). I've had my eyes on him ever since and I'll watch pretty much any film he directs. His newest film Parasite (2019) is not only the best film I've seen from him so far, but it might also be the best film I've seen so far this year. He may have crafted his own masterpiece. This film is sharp, it's tight, and hooks you till the very end. It's very fast paced, it's an extremely intense edge of your seat thriller, and its comedic at times which adds some levity to the film. The performances are all excellent across the board, the script, the dialogue, and the writing are all brilliant, and the score is very intense and enthralling. And to top it all off this film is shot very well, the cinematography and directing are great, and the shot composition is very interesting. And above all else this is just a very fast paced and interesting film that was incredibly fun to watch. I can't wait to see it again, I can't praise this film enough in words. See it as soon as you can, I highly recommend it, and it might be the best film I've seen so far this year!","Sep 14, 2019"
10,An Absolute Must See!,"A timeless Masterpiece, a review wouldn't do this film proper justice, just go watch it. Well deserving of its four oscars in Best Picture, Directing, International Feature Film and Writing (Original Screenplay). Still i am a bit dissapointed that non of the cast was even nominated for acting. All around gripping and mesmerizing preformances & plot.","Feb 16, 2020"
10,"darkly humorous, compelling, dramatic.","The latest film for Snowpiercer director Bong Joon-ho, Parasite, might very well be his best film to date. Parasite is a thought-provoking film that's part dark comedy, part family drama and part thriller. It's not really a singular genre film, but all these elements complement each other to deliver a surprisingly intense and shocking cinematic experience.

Meet the Kim family, a down-on-their-luck, destitute family of four. Living in an impoverished basement in a South Korean slum, they are forced to glum off of other people's WiFi networks and take menial side jobs folding pizza boxes to bring in a pittance of money. The family's eldest son, Ki-woo (Choi), failed to make it into university, but what he lacks in book smarts, he makes up for in street smarts. He's a natural con artist with the gift of gab. An opportunity soon falls into Ki-woo's lap in the form of a job recommendation. His best friend, Min (Park Seo-joon), is traveling abroad and wants Ki-woo to take over tutoring one of his well-to-do teen students, Park Da-hye (Jung). Min-Hyuk has a romantic interest in the high-school sophomore Da-Hye and wants Ki-woo to watch over her and keep away potential suitors while he's abroad. Min-Hyuk's master plan is to start dating Da-hye when she enters university.

Min-Hyuk's trust in a scam artist like Ki-woo is probably the biggest mistake of his life. With the help of his sister Ki-jung's (Park So-dam) exceptional forgery skills, Ki-woo is easily able to maneuver himself into the rich, well-to-do Park household as the new English tutor for Da-hye. Da-hye's mother, Mrs. Park (Jo Yeo-jeong), is a flighty, snooty simp. She makes for an easy mark for the Kim family to assert themselves into the lives of the Park homestead.

After Ki-woo hatches a master plan, he's able to manipulate Ki-jung into the Park home as the art tutor for the Park's youngest child, Da-song (Jung Hyun-joon). Next up, the kids trick the Park family patriarch, (Lee Sun-kyun), to fire his driver and hire their dad Ki-taek (Song Kang-ho). After that, it's the family housekeeper, Moon-gwang (Lee Jeong-eun), who gets ousted and replaced by the Kim kids' mother, Chung-sook (Jang Hye-jin). However, Ki-woo's carefully layered plan is nothing more than a house of cards, and a dark secret within the Park household threatens to shatter the Kim's ticket to money and luxury.

Parasite is a brilliantly shot movie. It's very much a product of its country of origin. As a result, its style is both unique and refreshing when compared to Hollywood films. It's darkly comedic, but it's not exactly an irreverent comedy. At other times, the film is darkly tragic and surprisingly poignant.

The lengths to which the Kim family goes to con and manipulate the Park family are both shocking, and at times, borderline detestable. The one thing that keeps the Kim family from being outright unlikable is their true familial bond. The Kim family is comprised of down-and-out scoundrels, and yet, they still love, respect and appreciate each other. Meanwhile, the white-collar Park family members are self-absorbed, obsessed with their status, image and wealth, and they appear to lack genuine love for one another. If anything, it appears that their wealth and status have made them soft and gullible. The Parks look down at others of a lower social standing. It's evident that while material wealth might bring certain comforts and convenience, it doesn't bring true love or happiness.

This is a remarkable film about the rich vs. The poor and the dynamics therein. While the Parks are generally the protagonists of the story, they are not good people. One imagines if Ki-woo, who comes off as quite brilliant, would likely be better served investing his talents into more legitimate pursuits. His sister, Ki-jung, is equally brilliant and a gifted graphic artist. It's bizarre that these two couldn't apply themselves in school or make it into university. Perhaps that's either a flaw in the storytelling or commentary on the South Korean academic system.

The performances of the main cast are impeccable. Song Kang-ho, as Kim Ki-taek, really steals the show with some surprisingly dramatic and bittersweet moments. While Ki-woo is the basic protagonist of Parasite, Ki-taek is the heart and soul of the movie. The second and third acts feature plot twists that are both surprising and shockingly satisfying. They are twists the audience will not see coming, but they make complete and total sense. Those are the best kind of cinematic ""gotcha"" moments.

Bong Joon-ho and cinematographer Hong Kyung-pyo construct some beautiful imagery. The film is wonderfully shot. The shots are very straightforward, crisp and clear, yet contain all sorts of compelling imagery. The third act also features some quick, surprising, shocking bits of violence and gore that are rather Tarantino-esque. Parasite pulls no punches in terms of its visuals and narratives.

While many are throwing around the word ""masterpiece"" for this film, it might be premature to call it that. Bong Joon-ho has created something with Parasite that's darkly humorous, compelling, dramatic, poignant and bittersweet all at the same time. Parasite is a true cinematic experience that will leave the audience with a lot to chew on during the ride home.","Feb 17, 2022"

(It's been a month since I'm still in effect.) The way he describes events and emotions is very interesting. I follow South Korean films as much as possible. I have not seen this kind of narration either in South Korean cinema or in other countries.

10,This movie is sticking with me.,"I saw this movie a couple of weeks ago and it's sticking with me.

I can't give a solid review yet because I'm still processing everything. Not so much processing but there are so many layers to this movie from rich to poor to cons to subtleties that the average movie-goers might miss.

This is a must see and I truly hope it wins Best Foreign Film this year if not Best Picture.

What a film.","Nov 26, 2019"
10,Best movie of the year. Clearly Oscar Worthy.,"Bong joon ho gives you everything in this movie. Laughs, Suspense, Disgust, Empathy, Shock and Hope. The message is so woven into the film and subtle. Hardly a flaw in the film. The film does not talk down to it's audience and presents characters who are not your stereotypical rich and poor. The movie makes you think, a deep long think. The runtime of 132 mins is hardly noticeable in this fast faced storytelling with a crisp screenplay. Bong Joon Ho is hands down one of the best directors of our times. Deserves all the accolades it has been garnering.","Feb 10, 2020"
10,Magnificent,"Parasite is a must see film for the ages. It was fantastic a film that needs to be seen on the big screen. The acting was some of the best I have seen in years.

10,Masterpiece.,"Even the poster for this movie is perfect. It's full of heartbreak, intrigue, suspense. There's wonderful acting and beautiful camera work. The colors are fantastic.

10,Great film,"Surprisingly easy to watch. It's a film on many levels starting as a gentle comedy, morphing into something a lot more macabre. Seeks to provide commentary on social class in Korea as well as a nod to the political environment of having a non friendly neighbour in the North. The title is brilliant","Feb 19, 2020"
10,everything,This movie is everything....i wish i could give more than 10,"Mar 27, 2020"
10,A social mobility and inequality tale.,"Not much to say about this dark heist/comedy movie besides that is awesome and works in so many levels. The places, sets and photography, all works to transmit the same cohesive message that the plot tries to convey. It does all this without being preachy or heavy handed. The performances are top notch and with enough nuances to make them credible. If I try hard to look for errors, maybe there are some characters' actions during the climax that feel that they needed more build up to occur in the way that they did.","Dec 28, 2021"
10,Parasite,"Bong Joon Ho's chilling satirical masterpiece addresses the age old theme of social class. Much like Bong Joon Ho's previous work, Snowpiecer (2013), the question of why some people are seen as ""lower"" and some people are seen as ""higher"" class is asked. The film also explores what we have to sacrifice to change social classes under a capitalist system. The narrative follows the Kims, a poor family who con their way into becoming the servants of a rich family, the Parks. Their easy life gets complicated when their deception is threatened with exposure. What follows is a fascinating spectacle which is sometimes operatic in nature and a sad reflection of modern life. Although it is all set in South Korea, the story works so well because it is universal and could have been set practically anywhere. It could be argued that there are no villains in the film, just people; however, it is anything but a soap opera. It is a commentary on the human condition. Nothing is black and white, just shades of grey. Parasite offers a way of seeing the world which feels unlike anything most Western audiences have seen before. However, there are still some films which it does bear some stylistic similarities to. Hitchcock comes to mind with films such as Psycho (1960) and The Birds (1963). There is also a twist in the tail which does feel slightly Hitchcockian. I could also see traces of films with a more biblical and spiritual quality to them such as Paul Thomas Anderson's Magnolia (1999). The acting was convincing throughout with stand out performances from Kang-ho Song and Sun-kyun Lee which puts the audience on edge. The spider-like way Bong Joon Ho directed his cast to move added to the sense of uneasiness. The writing is spot on with some razor sharp wit which, combined with the direction, made for some side-splitting moments. However as a contrast to the more humorous points in the film, there are moments of real sadness and pain. The contrasts beautifully represent life, because what is life if not a series of contrasts?","Feb 18, 2020"
10,Truly a masterpiece!,"You know a movie is good when there's been two months since you saw it and you're still thinking about it. I've enjoyed Bong Joon Ho's previews work but I wanted to enter the cinema with with a clear mind and no expectations. And I was shocked. The movie, every aspect of it, is perfect, from music to script everything was just beautiful. Easy best movie of the year and one of the best of this decade.","Dec 23, 2019"

10,I understand now why this is so critically acclaimed.,"I've been a fan of Bong Joon-ho movies for a bit now. This is by far the best one I've seen. I'm not going to go into detail about anything. Just try to avoid spoilers before watching the movie. Trust me. If you've seen a Bing Joon-ho movie and like his style of directing, you'll like this. If you are just a fan of movies in general, you'll like this. As far as I know, there is not a dubbed version of this movie. If you're okay with subtitles, this wont be a problem. I understand that subtitles can be distracting, but I urge you to watch this movie anyway.","Mar 29, 2021"
10,Perfect film,"This film contains everything you want in a movie. Characters who are complex - not all good or all bad, interesting homes, humor, suspense, surprise, sex and depth. I was on the edge of my seat for much of the movie. It's the best movie I've seen all year.","Dec 28, 2019"
10,Good Movie,"It's hard to explain for me... at first I think it's only comedy movie but at last, it showed me I was wrong. I said to myself I liked this movie..and also scared of it.. It was interesting movie of real life. This is my first Korea movie ,so I think it good.","Mar 14, 2020"

10,Bong Joon-Ho's ultimate genre-defying chef d'oeuvre embodies class warfare and capitalist hysteria,"In Bong Joon-Ho's game-changing social critique, the rich and the wretched descends into capitalist hell in sardonic, comical, and horribly grounded fashion.

Notions of class hierarchy have been told and retold by cinema over the decades. Predominately attached to the socioeconomic spectrum, stratification has always stirred up a profound impact on societies' minds when it comes from caustic satires or reactive commentaries. Ranging from Michael Bay's greedy paradox ""Pain & Glory"" to Alfonso Cuaron's autobiographical black-and-white gem, from Sean Baker's thoughtful portrait of post-financial crisis in ""The Florida Project"" to Paul Feig's Oscar-nominated powerhouse ""Bridesmaids"", capitalist prototypes and social dynamics have come and gone in all sorts of unimaginable shapes to bring out the inner demons of human survival.

In times of cholera and uncertainty, Bong Joon-Ho's latest and buzziest masterpiece comes like a head-turning accomplishment, a surgically accurate class fable, a truly gripping multi-genre piece of entertainment, and a reinvigorating storytelling-rich decade-new awake. Ever since its Palme d'Or win, ""Parasite"" has been ground-breaking new history, not only by becoming the very first non-English language, non-epic-length period drama nabbing the Best Picture award at the 2020 Oscars ceremony- golden ticket Cuaron's ""Roma"" lost to polarizing, preachy ""Green Book"" back in 2019 -but by giving new life into movie-going experience in an aging era of convoluted streaming-service battles and rowdy franchise-building tentpoles.

In a way, ""Parasite"" feels like the ""Inception"" of this new century. Back in 2010, Christopher Nolan's towering 160-million Russian doll odyssey opened several doors industry-wise, putting the absolute, always-coveted formula into one single movie: crushing box office incomes, cerebral, wholly original storytelling, and, above else, priceless craftsmanship power. However, Nolan did not treasure any social-resounding message as sharply as Bong Joon-Ho did overseas. ""Parasite"", on the other hand, is a small-budgeted, South-Korean thinking piece that, even while managing different procedures- it turned out to be more profitable than Nolan's pic -comes to the very same conclusion: great filmmaking is the key. Social-headed slices of art would never be about big budgets and small films like ""Get Out"" and ""The Invisible Man"" are proving that studios, either big or small, may still conquer audiences with entertaining, on-point storytelling.

Script-wise, ""Parasite"" is an utter knockout. At first glance, the most outstanding, praised features the film exposes now and again are its turns and twists, the comings and goings of a story where everything mutes into something unexpected. These ""think-again"" premium plot devices are the main pulling force for mainstream audiences, even though they are not the most powerful assets Joon-Ho has to offer. The truly one-of-a-kind centerpieces are: proceedings and composition.

Take for instance the 5-minute towering montage at the end of the first act, where black humor, cadence and rhythm are the beating heart of the sequence. It builds and places anticipation at the highest level by using endless narrative tricks to convey the emotions and reactions the film intends to spring up, blurring the line between good and bad, between wealth and the poverty, between sarcasm and irony.

The film succeeds at it, mainly, from hugely magnetic characters. When first we met the Kim family, they leave their banjiha's windows wide-open in order to get free extermination. They are poor, unemployed and Wi-Fi-needed. The film develops them one by one in a highly audience-catching way, picturing them as both victims and victimizers as the film evolves. Later on, the Park family steps in. They are wealthy, intellectual, picture-perfect individuals. However, unlike the Kim family, the Parks are not portrayed as villains until the masterfully executed final sequence, where each missing piece fits in. For most of its running time, they are naïve, nice elite people who do not want to get sick by their long-time loyal housekeeper. And that feeling of correspondence the film gets from its audience, regardless of origin, race or social status, comes from a core aspect: empathy. We care about them, we are invested in their tragedies, we are as worried and shocked as the characters themselves. Empathy is paramount for wining audiences over, without it, most of the film's purposes would be directly trashed out, and the South-Korean director knows it better than anyone; if not, just take a look at any of his previous works.

Every one of the characters succeeds at becoming storytelling backbones because of the amazing ensemble cast, which- by the way -became the very first foreign Ensemble Winner at SAG Awards, making, one more time, movie history. Park So-dam, Lee Sun-kyun, Choi Woo-shik, Cho Yeo-jeong, and Song Kang-ho deliver award-worthy performances, endowing to the story tangible, three-dimensional characters that, in incompetent hands, would come out as hollow caricatures.

Bong Joon-Ho's pictures are described as many things at once: black comedies, social commentaries, genre-crossing post-apocalyptic adventures. Owning every inch of them, ""Parasite"" spices the mix up with deeper, timely metaphors- make no mistake, peaches and basements are not going to be the same; - however, the film owes it to two crucial aspects: visual language and edition. Camera movements, blocking and visual composition are masterfully managed by the director and his crew. It could have been a silent film, and still it would speak volumes. Cinematographer Hong Kyung-pyo executes his vision with perverse precision and voyeuristic delight, grabbing class divide by the throat. What could have ended up as a mere style exercise between the shady lighting from the semi-basement and the luxury LED lighting of the main mansion, it is now the perfect visual cocktail: sophistication and softness, luxury and poverty, ups and downs, dark and light, hungry beasts in empty spaces.

""Okja"" composer Jaeil Jung plays an important role as well, shaping the mood and complementing the atmosphere, endowing the film with rich, elegant, horror-like sound scales, getting a heart-stopping, small yet often disturbing soundtrack by adding up layer after layer of complex composed sounds.

""Gisaengchung"" by Bong Joon-Ho is the crowning achievement of the decade. Many critics have healed it as ""the picture of the year"" and, even if it is tout à fait true, ""Parasite"" transcends the boundaries of society-headed, industry-transforming films; say Jordan Peele's ambitious allegory ""Us"" reimagined through the lens and voices of Shakespeare, Hitchcock and Kim Ki-young, and still you are nowhere near to it. Many talented, socially-aware filmmakers and their equally committed crews have paved the way through the years; now Bong Joon-Ho, in total command of his craft, has made it: ""Parasite"" is a groundbreaking work of art.","Jun 8, 2020"
10,It's restored my faith in film!,"From the beautiful cinematography, blocking, locations to the fantastic acting and screen play it is a must watch movie.

10,It truly is one of the greatest movies ever made.,"It sickens me that there are people voting this film down strictly because they feel the Academy was attempting to be ""woke"".

Simply put, this is a stunning film that more than deserves every accolade it received and then some.

I haven't felt so passionate about a film in quite some time and I truly feel we are witnessing an all time classic being born

Bong Joon-ho delivered a masterpiece and we are privileged to see it. Kudos to the Academy for finally breaking the ridiculous void of not honoring any foreign language films for the top prize.","Feb 12, 2020"
10,Deserves the Hype !,"After watching the Oscars I was curious about Parasite and knew I would have to watch it. I wasn't disappointed at all, most times when people hype something up I tend to think it's overrated. I was rooting for this down on their luck family even though they were technically committing a crime. Who hasn't lied on a resume to get a job ? I didn't see the ending coming at all so that was a shock.","Feb 12, 2020"

10,You were not expecting this movie...,"From its foreign dialogue to its perfect cinematography, this movie will keep you glued to your screen. I saw this movie not knowing anything at all about it, with no expectations, and yet it has been one of the best films I have seen. This film takes any genre you can think of to its maximum: drama, suspense, horror, action, vengeance, happiness, sadness, and many more. I would recommend this movie to anyone, it is simply just that good. Hands down the best movie of 2019.","May 1, 2020"
10,Oscar Season is here,I'm on an Oscar binge right now. And WOW this movie suprised me. Not a huge fan or foreign films and having to read a lot of the subtitles but I couldn't miss this with all the hype around it. Such a crazy thriller and a lot of funny moments with it as well. Not gonna give anything away because I feel everyone who sees this should go in it blind. By far one of the best movies of the year.,"Jan 29, 2020"
10,The clear Oscar frontrunner,"This year the Academy Awards have gone even more nonsensical than usual. Not only did they unjusitfiably snub many deserving people and movies, but over-ladened a few films with much more recognition than they deserve.

Once Upon A Time in Hollywood - 10 Oscar noms. (why?) Joker - 11 Oscar noms. (why?)

Parasite? 6. (all deserved).

Basically, the Oscars are more of a joke with each passing year. However in saying that, at least they gave 6 nominations to Parasite, which in my opinion is the clear frontrunner for Best Film.

It's the most interesting and engaging movie of the year, and the most successful Korean movie in history, both in Korea and around the world. I highly recommend it.","Jan 14, 2020"

10,Must Watch for everyone!,"Whether you're a hardcore cinephile or a normal movie-goer, Bong-joon-ho's Parasite has got something for everyone.

10,All in one!,"Amazing film, completely worthy of the Oscars it won. It did not follow the typical three act story, instead, it is like watching two movies in one: the first part, a comedy or satire, the second part was more like a thriller. However, the screenplay and the photography made both parts feel as a whole. During the 132-minute movie, it put the audience through many different emotional states. It is a movie that develops many topics resulting from the capitalist world and the increasing difference of the wealth of the rich people and the misery of the poor. It explains the differences between the social classes, emphasizing not only how the opportunities are different for both, but also how climate change affect them differently. However, is not the typical movie that romanticizes the working class, but rather show them with disunity among them and as people who live from the wealth of their masters and do not hesitate to smash others for a little bit of wealth. Moreover, both classes do not seem to understand nor show some care among them. The wealthy people live from the work of the poor, while the poor live from the wealth of the rich...then, who is the parasite, are there more than one? Another thing the director shows in this movie is the social death resulting from poverty. All this is shown in screen through a complex yet understandable symbolism and the mood is perfectly settled with the music. The photography and editing is also really good, my favorite part was a montage with combined more than 20 scenes. A piece of art to enjoy!","Mar 12, 2020"
10,The best film of the decade perhaps,"Simply put, there's no way to explain what a masterpiece of satisfaction this movie is. Just watch it. I don't even want to explain what it's about...I think it's best if you just blindly go into it. Completely expect it to win best foreign film at the oscars.","Oct 30, 2019"
10,Korean movie niubi!!,"Nice and deep, great movie! This Korean palm is worthy of the name!!","Aug 14, 2019"
10,Astounding!,"It is difficult to not spoil a movie when all you want to do is to talk about it, specially when it is truly astounding.

Bong Joon Ho, the acclaimed director of Snowpiercer brings us this amazing masterpiece, a grueling story of the lengths people will go to come out of a desperate situation.

All I will say of the story is that in its core it's the tale of two families, a very wealthy family that has everything, yet they have nothing, and a very impoverish family that has each other to a fault. But when their worlds collide there is bound to be a catastrophic catharsis.

In the age of remakes, sequels and reboots it is very hard to find a movie that is not only very original in its premise, but that it also manages to amaze you and shock you to the very core, to your very foundation.

The movie is very well shot, and it has amazing performances, specially from Woo-sik Choi and So-dam Park, who is rapidly becoming a rising star among Korean actresses.

The film won four Academy Awards, and it deserves every single one of them, it is well-paced, the story is engaging, it has amazing performances, an astonishing photography, and it is masterfully put together by a visionary director, whose unapologetic take to show the ugly side of humanity makes this movie unforgettable.

It would almost be a crime not to rate this movie a 10 out of 10.

There have been talks to make an American adaptation: do not mess with greatness!","Feb 26, 2020"
10,Best Movie in a long time,"Bong Joon Ho has made incredible movies in his movie career, but this is without a doubt his best, as well as the best movie released in 2019, and also one of the best movies of the decade. Playing masterfully between different genres, Parasite is surprisingly one of the most universal movie of the century. I know that subtitles can be new to some, but the worth of this movie can´t be tamed by subtitles.","May 18, 2020"
10,A masterpiece!,"After a long time watched a movie which can go into so many different genres, making it a masterpiece. Being a non-English film winning an Oscar sure explains it. This starts out as an entertaining casual comedy but with the surprising plot twists this dives deep into a strong comparison of the wealth gap and the psychological states between social classes, especially portraying the rage of the lower class.

Other than those, the cinematography, lighting, foreshadowing of events, the plot were outstanding. This film gave me a feeling similar to that of the ending of Breaking Bad.. Won't give out any spoilers, this is a must watch film for anyone! This will probably go down in history as one of the best movies of all time.","May 1, 2020"
10,Weirdly fascinating black comedy,"The Kims, a clever but out-of-work family living in a Seoul basement slowly inveigles themselves into the lives of the Parks, a wealthy family living in a designer home looking down on the city, only to discover that they are not the only people abusing the Park's unwitting hospitality. Bong Joon-ho's Oscar winning exploration of class distinctions is an entertaining spin on the 'upstairs/downstairs' diptych and is very well made, with an engaging cast, great production values and cinematography and an excellent score. Next only to 2017's 'The Shape of Water', 'Parasite' is the most unusual film ever to take home the Oscars for Best Picture and Director (but deservedly on both counts). Fun and memorable.","Mar 29, 2021"
10,Not a leech (?),"Of course Parasite could be anything ... which is why you should avoid Spoilers at all costs. Many have made a point about this and they are right. If you like movies with social commentary, this one is for you. It is so good, you want to talk about everything. Performances, story and all of it.

If you don't mind the subtitles go for it. I am expecting there to be an American remake anytime soon. So watch it before it becomes a thing. Especially now with the Golden Globes win and Oscar recognition (both deservedly!). South Korean cinema especially concerning drama and thrillers is really something I can advise anyone to watch. The quality is high and there are many things to discover. Not to mention they deliver surprises for anyone watching ... which is a good point for this movie too!","Jan 15, 2020"
10,Magnificent thrilling and unexpected story,"The plots are refreshing and thrilling and the movie itself has one of the best paces I recently experienced in a movie.

It was best described rollercoast slow ascendts and quik descents. I loved it!","Sep 27, 2019"
10,A craft masterclass by a genius,"I watched Parasite twice at the 36th Annual JFF (Jerusalem Film Festival) and I have to say, the film is still in my head. The genre of the film is absolutely different from other Hollywood's franchises, trust me (Bong Joon-ho was right!).

This review doesn't contain spoilers (although I do recommend to not read this before you watch the film).

""Parasite"", directed by a an artist himself Bong Joon-ho, is a social satire comedy-tragedy film that, like the film ""Us,"" tells of two families of different status, one of whom lives in the basement apartment and in unemployment condition. Each member of the poor family plans to sneak into a wealthy family's estate until they are exposed to unexpected twists.

The film won the Palme d'Or award at the Cannes Film Festival and the Sydney Film Festival at the Sydney Film Festival, and in fact, it deserved and won these awards (Eat Straw, Pulp Fiction). Why? Now comes the twist.

On the one hand, Bong uses a very creative black comedy, as I will describe below, to improve stories of inequality, economic imbalance, inherent corruption and power abuse that reflect South Korean society's view. And on the other hand, all seven Bong films cover the genres, from science fiction to police proceduralism to the small-town murder mystery, but they all have many things in common. Such as: in the films ""Mother"" and ""Memories of Murder,"" Bong uses his films to reflect the problematic establishment of Korea, South Korea in particular, and the perfect results. As mentioned, this film is ignored by the genre's conventions: it's soft and cruel; Beautiful and hard; Beautiful and tragic and a masterpiece in her classroom investigation.

The screenwriters, Bong Joon-ho and Han Jin Won, use a lot of twisted sleeves in the plot to make the movie more entertaining this year. Each line is delivered smoothly, as if these characters seem to be real people living in this story, with Jung Jaeli's classic score playing tremendously in the background. The cinematography by Hong Kyung-pyo distinguishes itself from a more realistic grainy style in the basement apartment, to a smoother style when focusing on our rich characters. This point of view causes us to look at two very opposing groups of people differently to make it even clearer that they do not belong to the same world. The classroom systems did not look earthy but still perfect before.

Bong makes sure to simplify the lines between the two sides at certain points and cause your sympathy to jump back and forth with hectic consequences. It is a film that focuses on poverty, despair and what we are willing to do to take what needs to be ours. The tension between supreme elegance and underground threat has never been more in your face. Therefore, Bong likes to blur the lines of the genre and he makes sure he hits every step in the stairwell to succeed.

""Parasite"" is a craft masterclass in which the power of the story lies in the way comedy and drama rub off on each other in the proper way to ignite a bit of thriller that turns into pure horror when despair and hatred meet each other. This is also not a film that built on one plot twist at the end, it's completely different from any Hollywood film that makes viewers angry at the viewer who just finished watching and suspecting him. This film will be remembered in the history books of world cinema, and foreign cinema in particular as one of the most creative films of the year in general. If not, then Hollywood is completely out of control.","Aug 4, 2019"
10,Careful organized movie,"Even though somewhat too dramatic, I do really enjoy this movie.

Most of the scenes and plots are well organized and designed, and also several key points about humanity.","Jul 7, 2020"
10,BIGGEST RIDE OF 2019,"Despite being incredibly edited and filmed. Beautiful dark cinematography. This movie takes you on a full on ride that no one is waiting for. The surprise factor and the randomness of the situations just keep adding up none stop. With a break point that leaves you with that empty feeling that something just ducked your soul and destroyed you inside but at the same time made you laugh and stay on deep silence to just digest.

Starting of by showcasing extremely complex characters you already know that you signed up for something entirely unusual. Lies and desperation can lead to absolute apocalypse. Every single scene adds to the story but it also makes it more twisted and complicated.

Do yourself a favor and watch this film.","Oct 21, 2019"
10,Parasite,"This movie was really good, interesting, unique, engaging, etc. Then the second half hit and it became phenomenal. I knew nothing about this movie going into it and I think that's the best way to go into it. I actually thought it was a sci fi/horror thing based on the title. It's not. It's socio-economic commentary, which I'm sure doesn't make it sound interesting but it is an absolute must watch. Up there with Oldboy in quality.","Apr 22, 2021"

10,Parasite - an unconventional storytelling,"What is Parasite - A Satire? Sarcasm, humor, emotion, human condition, suspense, thriller, social issues, drama, thought provoking dialogues, strong and smooth acting - all ingredients cooked with utmost perfection and balance and served with elegance and style.

It is an unconventional storytelling, it may look very simple and everyone might watch and love this film but it has layers of strong and complex structure and an extraordinary artistic flavor. The beauty of cinema lies in its frame, because that's the window through which we watch and experience the story. And that's where comes the cinematography and the production design, it has a rich and subtle tone with detail level precision , every frame, every shot is unforgettable. Another unconventional part of this movie is it's background score, we hear operatic music during a slow motion chaos. May be the background score is inspired from Hitchcock movies.

This film and the characters do not leave you after you finish watching, it stays with you, even if you want you can't escape from them, then slowly you learn to live with them in your head, because you are also one of them. It is a hypnotic movie which is disturbing but you will still want to watch it again and again, probably because you want to laugh, cry and get scared - all at the same time.

Parasite touches so many corners of human emotions without trying too hard to over amplify any scene or sequence. Kudos to Director Bong Joon-ho for his visionary approach to tell a story which is not unknown to anyone, forcing us to believe that we are very much part of this cruel world.","Feb 8, 2020"
10,Parasite is one of the most emotional movies of all times,"Parasite leaves a strong and lasting effect on viewers. It has surprising and funny story that turns out to be more than a life it self. Actually, it is a life, painted in all colors. In a film industry, Parasite is a Vincent van Gogh.

This screenplay is one of the best in a long time, incorporating elements that fit together like a puzzle, the characters are all deep and compelling, the score will be stuck in my head for a long time, and the story is one to go in without knowing anything.

10,100X better than Roma,"With a masterful script and Bong Joon-Ho's (usual) brilliant direction, this film is easily one of the best of the year. The entire cast give amazing performances which keep you gripped and thats the main difference between this and Roma. I myself am not usually one for foreign films so if your first attempt at a foreign film was Roma and you found that a chore to sit through as I did, I urge you to watch Parasite. You won't be disappointed and the trailers do it absolutely no justice. Definitely a best director and best picture contender at the Oscars this year.","Jan 15, 2020"
10,Entertaining!,"A must see if you are tired of endless Hollywood sequels and super hero movies. A can't miss if you are into Quentin Tarantino type of movies (although, without a heroic central character). This is a very entertaining story that's beautifully shot and told with many twist and turns, at a nice and tight pace, from start to finish.","Oct 27, 2019"
10,Who were the titular Parasites?,"Parasite (Gisaengchung) (2019) is directed and written by Bong Joon Ho. It is a thriller that tells the story of a poor, Lower class family that slowly worm their way into the household of a rich, upper class family. One by one the family get hired to do a job, with the employers unaware that they are a family. Things take an unexpected turn in the third act and I can honestly say that I wasn't expecting the way that this movie ended up. I really enjoyed Parasite and in my opinion, it deserves the Academy Awards that it won.","Feb 16, 2020"
10,Movie of the decade and I say this with absolute confidence,"Finishing this movie left me in AWE. Everything from the transition from a lighthearted introduction to a thriller drama, the directing, the intricate storyline (notice how connected everything is - really shows great scriptwriting), the reversal of roles and even the lumming existence of reality...I could go on for HOURS. To keep a long story short, this movie was SPECTACULAR. Do not shy away from this movie. The Academy has done something right.","Feb 20, 2020"
10,Wonderful story telling,I am not someone who gives high high ratings. Seeing this film I now understand the awards it has one. This story transcends all cultures in all countries. The haves and the have nots. It exemplifies that it does not matter in the full realm how life ends up. The acting was superb and watching it in the original language made it so more realistic.,"Apr 14, 2020"
10,On Point!,"I'm going to put it simply: There's not a single thing this film does wrong.

The comedy is on point. The drama is on point. The moments of tension are on point. The commentary on social class is on point. Acting, writing, filmmaking - on point.

Parasite totally deserved the Palme D'Or and I want this to win all the Oscars, all the Golden Globes, and any other awards it gets nominated for because everything in this s**t was incredibly on point.

Parasite is nothing short of a MASTERPIECE.","Nov 10, 2019"
10,Perfection,Perfect. What else can you say about the wonderful film.,"Feb 15, 2020"
10,Different,A movie that doesn't really belong to any genre. Still impresive story telling. One of the best of 2019,"Jan 1, 2020"
10,A quirky family comedy that transgresses into a vicious social satire on Korean class division,"I just this for the second time in cinemas and I loved it just as much as the first time. I cannot describe how thankful I am that this gem has been given a wide release in Australia before most countries, which is a rare occurrence, especially with foreign films.

The first time I saw this, I was absolutely enthralled by it because of the unique story being presented. I found it to be witty yet subversive, and I had no idea where it was headed. Bong-Joon Ho is a director who's work that I've seen at this point is something I greatly appreciate. He always manages to pull genuinely funny comedy out of his scenes that somehow feels natural rather than jarring. It doesn't diminish from the story's overall seriousness, nor does it ditract from the dramatic performances of the cast, especially Song Kang-Ho, who I have not seen give a performance that was not great yet. Where the story did head completely caught me off guard, but in a good way. It is one of the best uses of plot escalation I have seen in a long time, to the point where the film completely changes genres halfway through and it's astounding because it works so well. The stylistic features change with the tone shift as well, as the score becomes more tense and dramatic, and the camera movement becomes more sweeping and eratic. It's all so perfectly complementary to what's escalating on screen. The cinematography is so good that any shot could be used as the poster, and it would make good one at that.

The second time I saw this I payed extra attention to any hints or details that are presented which set up the escalation to come, and it was a truly rewarding experience. I think there's still things I won't pick up until my third or fourth viewing.

I absolutely adore this film, and I think everyone should check it out. I would even recommend it to those who confess to not liking foreign films because they have to go through the gruelling task of actually having to read what they're watching. This is my favourite of 2019 so far, and I would be very surprised if that changed from now.","Aug 14, 2019"
10,Best movie of the year. Stay pressed yall,"I don't even know what to say. from the story line, the plot, the actors, the meaning behind the movie is... incredibly art

standing ovation for Bong Joon Ho","Feb 17, 2021"
10,"Subtle, moving, intriguing and beautifully directed","It's a great story about social differences which will leave you amazed by its photographic qualities, the performances by the actors, and the plot!

I adore the way this movie is able to tell the story without being so stereotypically in-your-face about who is the bad guy and who is the good one.

If you like Lars von Trier and Stanley Kubrick, I think you will love this movie.","May 10, 2020"

10,This movie is masterpiece,"One of best crime/thriller i've watched. I can't guess where the plot will bring me, every minute in the movie i tried to guess but mostly i wrong, and got the unexpected, even the ending. Every character really has strong impact in the movie, and you must pay attention about every little detail they do, because that builds up the story, and has really deep meaning for the story. The movie itself is masterpiece, really worth watching.","Feb 15, 2020"
10,100% Watch Parasite! Its like no other,"This honestly is my most favorite movie of all time that I've seen so far! Theres a lot of fantastic movies but this is definitely no.1 then Get Out, all the John Wick sequels, Avatar and Titanic. Theres more but I'll stop here. But this movie right here in my 30 years of living tops every last one. Bong Joon-Ho is a genius! Him & BTS are doing their country really freaking proud. This just goes to show you theres so much outside most peoples bubble that they dont know about because they're unnecessarily to closed minded & prejudice. The world has so much to offer if you're open to all its possibilities & ignore the thousands telling you no. Higly recommended!!! 100/10","Jul 27, 2020"
10,"All-encompasing, unpredictable, engaging",This movie had it all. The premise was so strange and unique. I never knew what was going to happen next. It touched on important issues around class and family. Overall just excellent. One of the few movies that deserves 10 stars,"Jan 20, 2020"
10,Wow!,I heard nothing but great things about this film and upon watching it I had no idea what it was about or what to expected. I'm glad I watched it because it was like nothing I've ever seen before. I could definitely say it wouldn't be as impactful to me if it was American production with an all American cast. I would definitely recommend this watch!,"Oct 12, 2019"
10,Fantastic,"Loved so much about this film from the story to the cinematography, the performances the direction. A refreshing change from superhero films and over the top CGI studio films. It's funny it's sad it's intense. So switch off the phone, turn on the film and enjoy. You won't regret it.","Nov 28, 2020"

10,A Masterpiece/Work of art.,"As I write this, I want to describe my raw initial state after I finished the film, I'm in a state of complete awe, staring into the wall kind of awe, Parasite is truly a work of art, a sheer masterpiece. This film oozes with mastery, every little detail tells a story of its own, I was drawn to it like a moth to a flame, it grips hard and it never lets go, it sways between genres gracefully, it offers comedy both dark and light, drama, horror, thrill, and it's all packaged so seamlessly, conveyed to us throughout breathtaking performances across the board, I've watched my share of Korean Cinema to know that's a common thing but Parasite takes it to a whole other level, it materializes thoughts and ideas, things words can not communicate, it is extremely rare to experience such a thing in film, I can only name a small number of movies that actually made me feel this way, just incredible. Director Bong Joon Ho proves that he is a master within his own cross-genre domain, he takes charge and you actually feel like you're in safe hands watching this, he shapes the scenes perfectly, A true master of his trade, Thank You. In all honesty, I feel like I went through an experiment where the time went still and I experienced a piece of art such as this, I absloutely, wholeheartedly loved every single second of this film, MINDBLOWING.","Nov 26, 2019"
10,A great story & well executed,A roller coaster of a movie with great characters and plot twists. A narrative that draws you in from start to end. A movie to add to all time favorites.,"Apr 24, 2020"
10,Parasites linger,"Parasite, is a hard film to discuss, not because it's one of those films that is truly horrendous but genuinely its a hard film to talk about because its one those where you cant do your research, or where you can see any trailers because they would most likely spoil the outcome. The hard truth is, you have to go into it completely blind, because its one those films that can surprise you at any turn, essentially there are no words to describe this superb South Korean thriller but simply it's director: Bong Joon-ho.

This is pure Bong, it's insane, if you were to put it into one single genre you would a very hard to find trying to find which genre it would slot into, is it a horror? A thriller? A crime-caper? A comedy? Or is it just a drama? It's all of them, and none of them at the same time. But in a way in that sense that's the way that Bong creates his cinema, just for him, the man has no one genre he has not one single technique in his directing style. From his first film in 2000 Barking Dogs Never Bite, to Memories of Murder, through his monster invasion flick The Host, Snowpiercer and there's even no way to describe his last film Netflix's Okja they are all him. And his seventh film Parasite goes completely crazy in fact we're not sure if it's trying to be a meticulous crowd-pleaser or a mindbending thriller or an Art-house caper. The point is where he is trying to go he does it successfully. From the opening reel it'll have you intrigued and it scratch you out until you are unwillingly bridled to watch it again and again...

And why shouldn't you? It's perfect - the plot is watertight, the Kim family are poor and penniless and utterly hopeless, they are getting tired of their stingy underground basement apartment so the eldest son (Woo-shik) seeks out other opportunity besides living in squalor conditions. So he has a plan to work for the wealthy Park family in their stunning mansion, liking what he sees he decides to bring the rest of his family along for the ride, and for a while everything is going fine until the rise of an unfortunate incident. And that's when everything changes. Intrigued? Well, that's enough. Because when it comes to Bong it's not the story that matters its the way his characters are written, the way they delve into making new plans for the well-off Park family. No. What the story is a about, is family. Now we know what you're going to say, and you can refrain from that because this is the exact opposite, it's about a family who have nothing, then they go into everything and then they think they're doing fine until they slip. And that could result in a lot of things going wrong. For the first hour during the different plans you could essentially say that this is another version of The Italian Job minus the cars and Michael Caine or perhaps a mixture between Ocean's and Rififi and you'd be write it's all those. And much more, there's no knowing how many references to old films Bong has put here. But what he does in that first hour is absolutely captivating and the execution of the plans is one-of-a-kind cinema. It's a film that doesn't that doesn't really sound like it works, but it does. And here Bong has created a miracle of a film.

Joyously it couldn't have come at a better time, amidst all the modern cinema redos, remakes and been-there-done-that sequels this is a real miracle and Bong has a real gem on his hands. Plus naturally in crime caper when people get found out they lose everything, here there's no evidence of that, maybe (but remember no spoilers) but the Kims they just keep going until they have ruined enough of the Park family's well being. There's a moment of a threat of being caught but with eager hands they soon put a stop to that. The fact is Bong does nothing wrong here, Parasite is a perfect, water-tight and captivating thriller that will put your heart on edge, make you scratch your head and finally make wonder if cinema can get any better. No is the answer, and Bong could not have made it a better time as it will keep you going to the end reel and refuse to let go even well after the credits roll. He's essentially the Korean version of the Coen brothers, and there's no better compliment than that.

VERDICT: Bong has made a miracle of a film that's a water-tight crime caper, thriller and dram a plus many more genres all in one film. And with an unforgettable story it will keep you watching for years to come. Truly cinema at its best.","Feb 14, 2020"

10,Best Movie of the Year,"It's difficult to review a movie like this without revealing any spoilers. For real, you definitely want to avoid spoilers on this one. So, I'll just leave you with this.

Parasite is an absolute must-watch movie for anyone who loves movies. You owe it to your life to watch the work of a master like Bong Joon-Ho at his very best.

See it with a friend. Discuss it afterwards. Then see it again. You'll be glad you did.","Dec 8, 2019"
10,Roller coaster of emotions,"Bong's movie is truly a masterpiece for the ages. I was honestly surprised to see such a turn in plot, feelings and actions. My heart was a roller coaster of emotions, laughing and being comfortably sitted and later on the edge of my seat, not laughing now but still rooting for them. The soundtrack was gorgeous, the editing superb, the acting was so genuine and looked effortless. This movie really spiked my interest not only in more of Bong's movies but in korean movies in general!","Nov 8, 2019"

It's constantly evolving, never boring and so unpredictable. Bong Joon Ho is truly a genius and this is pure art. Everything about this film is perfect, there is not one thing I could name that i would change about it. It deserves all the praise it is getting. What a film.","Feb 10, 2020"

It slowly ramps up and never lets off until the final moments. Even if you aren't big on foreign films or subtitles just give this one a chance. It's as good as cinema has been in the last 50 years.,"Aug 1, 2021"
10,Very Good Film on the Wealthy vs. the Destitute,"While I'm not finished with the film as I right this, this film is a social study of the wealthy and the destitute. A poor family systematically infiltrates a wealthy family, essentially taking over the house in a sense. I have a feeling that this won't end well.","May 4, 2020"
10,Bong Joon Ho's masterpiece.,"By film critics awarded and praised movies are often an artistic statement on their own. But sometimes they do lack entertainment and the movie experience that mainstream viewers expect.

This movie on the other hand combines the outstanding art of cinematography and an exceptional movie experience. Every minute from the beginning to the very last scene is enjoyable and executed perfectly.

I read about the overwhelming critics and positive feedbacks about this film before I watched this movie. So I tried not to be too overhyped and biased. In fact, I tried to watch and enjoy it without thinking too much about the critics. And I was not disappointed at all.

Just watch this film and enjoy:


Korean cinema has brought us some gems to the big screen and Parasite is a diamond that is finally truely acknowledged by the academy.","Feb 25, 2020"
10,Masterfully crafted and outstanding performances,"A brilliant and thought-provoking movie that explores the themes of inequality and social mobility. It's a movie that will make you laugh, cry, and think deeply about the world we live in. The film is a must-see for anyone interested in the art of cinema.

The story is a testament to the power of cinema to tell stories that are both entertaining and meaningful. It's a movie that will stay with you long after you've watched it.

Overall, the film is a commentary on the social and economic conditions of modern society. It's a story about the haves and have-nots, and the lengths people will go to in order to survive. The film is both entertaining and thought-provoking, and it's a movie that will leave you with a lot to think about.

Really an exceptional movie that deserves all the praise it has received. It's a movie that will make you laugh, cry, and think deeply about the world we live in. The film is a must-see for anyone who loves cinema and wants to experience something truly special.","Jul 25, 2023"

10,This is why the rating scale goes all the way to 10,"Glad I managed to watch Parasite just before the Oscars. A most deserving winner, especially in Original Screenplay and Best Picture categories.

Only 10/10 I have given to a film, out of nearly 100 reviews.

I am not sure what genre Parasite is. I laughed, stood in the edge of my seat and got emotional all throughout a very compelling 2 hours and 20mins run time.

Parasite is a brilliant story about a poor family living in Seoul who tries to entrench themselves as workers in the house of the super wealthy Parks.

The contrasts between two lifestyles are beautifully portrayed and yet, unlike most movies, the rich ones are not made out to be jackasses or bad apples. They are merely a family. Certainly different, flawed, but not one you will actively root against.

The script is one of the most engaging I have ever seen. Builds at a perfect pace with the story and yet is positively full of suspense.

The acting is incredibly convincing, especially the poor family's patriarch Kim Ki-taek, who goes through a very wide range of emotions.

I have trouble pinpointing what else makes it so great, but the film flew by for me. I loved every bit of it.

Bong Joon-Ho created a masterpiece a very worthy recipient of the first Best Picture academy award for a non-English language film. It will certain open many others for others to follow him.

A must watch.

PS: the only movie that Parasite remotely reminded me off is Hirokazu Koreeda's Shoplifters (2018)","Feb 10, 2020"
10,Keeps you engaged. A humorous thrill ride,I couldn't help but laugh at the gullible rich family when the poor underdogs manipulated them and got jobs in their house. The second half is a great thriller. The movie has many twists that will leave you baffled. I don't want to spoil it for you. It is a must watch .,"Apr 13, 2020"
10,Like nothing you've seen before,"Holy crap. This is a tense movie. You really won't see the twist coming and even then you won't predict what happens. Funny, scary, sad, and yet weirdly sweet. Definitely deserved best picture. Insane.","Mar 5, 2020"
10,Another Korean masterpiece,Bong Joon-Ho did it again. A true masterpiece in acting and storytelling. You are hooked until the end of the story. Then you'll spend at least an hour after the credits thinking about it ! Avoid spoilers,"Oct 23, 2019"
10,What a movie👏,"I normally do not watch subtitle movies yet the reviews, awards, and comments from friends had me curious. I am thrilled I saw it. Not sure what to make of it. Acting and photography was grand. I know I will watch it again. I missed parts of the subtitles because they went by too fast. I got the gist so I allowed it to play through. Rented it through Apple TV, watched it in the comfort of our home 😎","Feb 16, 2020"
10,Feel from the bottom of the society,"After watching, I see my fight against the system (life, society, Capitalism) as a fight for all of the people who still eager for a fight.","Jul 3, 2019"
10,It's so metaphorical.,"Everyone said ""Go see Parasite"". Everyone said ""The one rule about Parasite is that you don't talk about Parasite"". So I went to see Parasite. So this is a review about Parasite without talking about Parasite.

Kim Ki-Woo (Woo-sik Choi) is a student living with his family in poverty in a sub-basement room, sponging off internet signals and scrounging a living, of sorts, by assembling pizza boxes. Opportunity presents itself when his best friend, the slightly older Min (Seo-joon Park), goes abroad to study. For Min is an English tutor to the up-market Park family's school-age daughter Da-hye (Ji-so Jung). Not wanting his fellow 'frat-boys' to move in on future romance - he's lined up Ki-Woo as his replacement.

Ki-woo knows he's lucked in when he visits the swanky Park residence and manages to pull the wool over the eyes of Da-hye's not too bright mother Yeon-kyo (Yeo-jeong Jo). But the influence of the family's ""lucky rock"" doesn't stop there. Ki-woo sees an opportunity to get jobs for his sister Kim (So-dam Park), his father Ki-taek (Kang-ho Song) and his mother Chung-sook (Hye-jin Jang). And gradually the poor Kim family start to encroach on the rich Park family's lives.

You might think that's the story. It's not. Just when you think you know where the film is going - a gentle comic tale with farcical elements - the movie takes a sudden left turn into The Twilight Zone.

To say more, if you've not seen the film, would be cruelty beyond measure. It's a truly astonishing script, by writer/director Bong Joon Ho, and my nomination for the Oscar for best original screenplay.

It's the details that get to you. This will be a superb film to watch multiple times. There are fabulous details scattered throughout. You know how the more expensive the car the more ""solid"" the clunk is as you shut the door? Listen to the sound effect when the Park front door shuts! Look what happens to the ""one of a kind"" lucky rock!

As for one of my favourite films from last year - ""The Farewell"" - you very quickly get to accept and embrace the subtitles. YOU MUST NOT LET THIS PUT YOU OFF. This is a masterpiece of cinema, well-deserving of its multiple Oscar nominations and its Cannes Palme d'Or award. At 132 minutes, it's not a short film, but seldom have two hours flown by faster. It's totally gripping. At times hysterically funny; at times shocking. A class struggle movie of a calibre that Ken Loach would never have imagined!

Gripes? I had just one. An action near the end of the movie seems bizarrely out of character and was a ""WTF"" moment that I didn't think the film needed. However, it did set up a wonderful story-telling finale that I will think about for many months.

It provoked that seldom found reaction in the cinema when the end-titles ran. A hubbub of chatter and appreciation.

It comes with a highly recommended from me.

10,Masterful storytelling that fully utilizes the art form.,"Bong Joon-ho seems to be incapable of making a bad film and this one might be his very best. Parasite is wickedly funny, stunningly tragic, and just gorgeously constructed from beginning to end.

The visual storytelling here is immaculate, the stair sequence, in particular, is incredibly crafted.The sound design and soundtrack are superbc subtle and strong in all the right places.This is probably the best-paced film I've seen this year, there's virtually nothing I could think of to trim.

I am deliberately avoiding talking about the film in more specific terms, you don't need me for plot summary there's plenty of that online already. Though I would suggest avoiding all of it if you really want to get as much out of this film as possible. Family is certainly a strong theme as is class struggle if that helps.

The acting is all excellent. Song Kang-ho continues to be one of the best actors working today. The dude will have you cracking up and then choking up within minutes of each other.

I'm not really able to talk about this film at length without spoiling it so I'll just say if you're a true fan of film, this is not one you can miss. This is the type of movie that reminds people why they love film in the first place.

10/10 First a trickle, then a flood","Nov 14, 2019"

10,Leave this page if you've never seen this film before,"Don't read another review. Don't watch a trailer. As soon as you get the next opportunity, watch this film. That's all.","Nov 14, 2019"
10,Who is the Real Parasite?,"A few moments into the movie, you start realizing that you are in the hands of a master storyteller, as without any exposition you are familiarized with all the characters and thier surroundings.

Director Bong Joon Ho has dabbled in murder mysteries, dystopian science fiction, as well as monster movies but this time he takes a very grounded and personal tale which makes you laugh, empathise, grin, and sit at the edge of your seat. By winning the Palme D'or at Cannes and hosting sold out screenings, Parasite had placed Bong Joon Ho in the cadre of the new masters of cinema.

The best way to to enjoy the movie is to go cluelessly into it, but what i can say about the plot is that it is flawless in writing and is edited to perfection. Not a single scene meanders and the story is tightly focused on the characters. Which brings me praise Kang-Ho Sok, who plays the father of the Kim family, making us sigh with his disappointment and smile whenever he takes pride in his family.

The cinematography in Parasite is a highlight as you get to see the grimy trinkets of Kim family's semi-basement house and polished expanse of park family's uptown villa. The background score selection is appropriate and perfectly blends in, while enhancing the drama.

While Parasite might be a suspenseful drama on surface level, it has layers to it in terms of metaphors and messages. It communicates class divide, makes us question the moral compass of the characters and ourselves, and makes you question: who is the real parasite in the movie?

Watch the movie and answer the question for yourselves.","Oct 21, 2019"
10,it's about time that the Oscars pay attention to these topics,"Bong Joon-ho's ""Gisaengchung"" (""Parasite"" in English) became the first foreign-language movie to win Best Picture at the Academy Awards. And it was a deserved win. Like ""Joker"", it employs some unusual methods to address class conflict in modern society. To crown everything, it takes a subtly comedic approach to the topic!

A lot of people had never heard of Bong before this movie. I've known about him ever since I saw ""The Host"". I've seen a couple of other Korean movies in addition to his movies. If this movie gets people interested in Korean cinema, then all the better; some great movies come from there. But in the meantime, this movie probably says more about modern society than just about any other movie from last year. Definitely see it.","May 11, 2020"
10,Easy to Understand,"The movie is simple in the fact that people like to move up the ladder. Seems removed from our lives, yet things start spiralling out of control, their lives seem not so different from our own daily lives. After some reflection, relatable. Who are the parasites in this society? Is it us? Or them? Or aren't we all living our lives in a cacoon, may it be a luxurious mansio or a rundown flat. We are no better those next to us, and they to us.","Aug 4, 2019"

10,Staggeringly original Korean social satire; one of the best of the decade,"I am more than delighted to say that this twisted dark comedy from South Korea more than lives up to the hype. It was the recipient of the Palm D'Or this year at Cannes and has received universally ecstatic reviews. It's an absolute masterpiece, and one of the best films of the past ten years.

I won't say too much about the plot to avoid giving anything away, but the film tells the story of a poor family of con artists in South Korea who begin to start being employed by a gullible, extremely wealthy family. The narrative manages to effortlessly and seamlessly combine astounding entertainment with efficacious and impactful social commentary. The film is loaded with substantial messages about class divides not only in South Korean society, but also in the world as a whole. From there, its main raison d'être expands to the analysis of how we can respond to such divides when placed in extreme situations. The results are shocking, startling, hilarious, and utterly brilliant. Such results certainly couldn't be achieved without a truly outstanding cast, but lucky for us, Bong Joon-ho has assembled an astonishing ensemble. Even more impressive is the film's character development. While the film's primary characters are often not the most ethical, they are surprisingly likable and multi-dimensional--especially when heightened by both emotion and tone. You'll certainly remember them long after the credits roll.

But what's most unforgettable about ""Parasite"" is that the film manipulates (in the best way possible) its tone in so many unique and engaging ways, that it is able to fully subvert the viewer's expectations of not only how the film will go, but how tone in a film of any kind can be executed under normative conditions. Combining laugh-out-loud, witty comedy, taut suspense, and moments of pitch-black darkness, viewers will be fully immersed in one of the most unpredictable narratives put on film of the past twenty years. While such tonal shifts may sound erratic, they could not have been done more perfectly here--so much so that the film ultimately feels like an unprecedented crescendo in its tone--especially given that the tonal shifts are made more impactful by the film's almost impeccable tightness, not wasting a single frame to keep the viewer fully and utmost engaged.

One review cited in the film's trailer calls ""Parasite"" a ""magic trick."" I couldn't agree more, both literally and figuratively. A definite 10/10.","Oct 20, 2019"
10,One of the better films of the decade,"Bong Joon Ho's latest film, Parasite, is a finely crafted potpourri. It opens with the Kim family (Chung-sook (wife), Ki-taek (husband), Ki-jung (daughter), Ki-woo (son)) in their semi-basement apartment, the perfect setting for this working class household struggling to keep their heads above ground. They rely on their neighbours for free wi-fi while they sit on the kitchen floor folding pizza boxes for cash. A friend of Ki-woo's has been tutoring the daughter of a wealthy family (the Park's) and when a replacement is needed, Ki-woo, with the help of his document forging sister, fakes his way into the job. The Parks require a significant amount of help to run their household and as such need an art teacher for their son, a driver for the father, and a housekeeper to maintain their luxurious home. The Kim's are a clever clan and find a way to infiltrate each of these positions through cunning and deceit, often usurping previous help. By this point, we understand enough to see that this is a film about class conflict. The Kim's appear to be the protagonists with a grand plan, and you'd expect the Park's to be characterized as either villainous or ignorant, but they're neither. They're quite a nice family, only they're focused on their own objectives. When the Park's leave for a weekend of camping, the Kim's take over the home, boasting and toasting their good fortune. Mid soirée they're interrupted by an unexpected visitor and that's when the action really begins. The film's screenplay is too unique to be classifiable and the twists and turns too unexpected to reveal. If my recommendation isn't enough, the film won the Palme d'Or at Cannes, a universal festival, unlike the Oscars which Bong called ""a local festival"" as part of his press tour to the tittering of film lovers. The film is distinctly Korean, but broadly relatable as we all live under the zero sum game of capitalism. Bong asks, who is the parasite? The labour class who need a job to survive, or the wealthy, who can't survive without their labour?","Jun 13, 2020"
10,A Truly Remarkable Work of Cinema,"With a fantastic cast, fabulous sense of direction, and a truly wild sense of storytelling, Parasite checks all the right boxes for a best picture winner, and proves to be something truly new, by also relying on things found familiar. The main cast is truly spectacular, with Kang-Ho Song and Cho Yeo-jeong providing for the best of the supporting performances. The dialogue is rich and relatable, and the humor in the film is well executed and surprisingly often. The film's pacing is by far one of its most brilliant remarks, with you never truly feeling bored throughout the almost 2 and a half hour runtime, and thoroughly entertained without. The film simply never stops, it doesn't shy away from different styles and genres of storytelling, but embraces them as one story and does it so cleanly, it truly is quite impressive. The cinematography is outstanding, with some truly beautiful visuals and captivating points of view. Though there are many interesting twists and turns that you may never truly see coming, the film can be a bit predictable at times with certain situations, and makes the film seem slightly less special in doing so. In the end however, Parasite is yet another brilliant work from Director Bong Joon-Ho and is one of, if not, the best work he has made to date. My Rating: 9.75/10","Mar 7, 2020"
10,Absolute Mind-blowing!,Just WOW! What a movie I have just witnessed here! Thoroughly gripping right from the beginning to the end. My eyes were glued during the whole 132 minutes. I wouldn't be surprised if this movie wins the Oscars for best picture. No criticisms whatsoever. A Must Watch for everyone out there!!,"Jan 31, 2020"
10,"Tops the ""Perfect"" chart","I am one of those people who watched this movie only after it won the Oscar. And one thing about giving in to any kind of hype is that it mostly doesn't live up to it. But boy, Parasite blew me away and how.

The point the maker is trying to make will definitely hit anyone who watches it. Humor is used beautifully. The climax is mindblowing. This movie comes closest to being absolutely perfect.","Apr 23, 2020"
10,The masterpiece of cinema 2019 desperately needed,"There have been a sparse few films in recent years that have melded genres seamlessly, performed at the absolute top of their game in technical craft, offered a scathing sociopolitical commentary, all while telling an airtight and compelling story. Luckily for us, Parasite (Gisaengchung) checks all of these boxes, in a year where we couldn't have needed it more badly. Bong Joon-ho's latest absolutely blows all else out of the water (at least compared to the other 30+ movies I've seen in theaters this year), and in a highly organic and original way. The issue of class and the struggles of the poor climbing the ladder to become wealthy is one that Bong Joon-ho is well-known for using, for instance in 2013's Snowpiercer, yet Parasite never at any point feels like it borrows from any of its predecessors or overlaps with them in any way. This is the film's greatest strength, in my opinion, that it so flawlessly weaves together all of its components, including an interesting and nuanced take on class-structure, originally and in such a way that it feels perfectly natural for the story being told. The same can be said for how Bong traverses from one genre to another. From minute to minute, Parasite will have you laughing uproariously, and then suddenly, have you dead-silent and on the edge of your seat. The comedy is dark and laugh-out-loud, while the suspense will make you want to lean in, if only to try and pull the characters out of the scene, so as to relieve the tension. It should be no surprise, that everything else also falls into place wonderfully, from the poignant performances, to the razor sharp editing, to the stunning cinematography. In a year with both high-budget and indie takes on class-struggle such as Joker and Us, Parasite still manages to stand out, in a class of its own.","Nov 17, 2019"
10,A film worth rewatching.,"I tend to evaluate a film by the time it takes us to discuss about it afterwards. Parasite just premiered in Romania and we just returned home, but it's two hours since we keep on discussing it- enough to rate it with 10 stars- which happens very seldom, I must admit. I am no connoisseur of Korean films, so I am not entitled to place it here or there, nevertheless I am totally in control of my personal film hierarchy and Parasite sits high and mighty somewhere on top. Is it a satire, a comedy, a thriller, a social fresco, a mystery? It's all of them and then some. It kept me on the edge of my seat for all of its two hours. It was informative of Korean lifestyle. It was entertaining. It was gruesome. It was comic. It was satirical. It was endearing. It was never boring. Not only the actors are great in it, but the house itself deserves a place of its own in the cast. As a traveler around the world I sometimes found myself in neighbourhoods just like the ones in this film- both the favela style ones and the super rich ones. Every time I was wondering how such poverty and such richness can coexist peacefully. Not anymore, although for my peace of mind I hope not so dramatically. Parasite made me laugh, made me cringe, made me question life, gave me food for thought. What more should I expect from a film? To watch it again, clearly!","Feb 8, 2020"
10,"The Social Commentary, It Showcases is Spectacular!","If a film makes you think continuously even after the show ends, it must be a great one! And this one did just that. Packed with terrific direction, commendable performances from the whole cast, the sheer excellence in story writing and screenplay alongside some beautifully crafted cinematography this film is surely a treat in every category. It made me think, it made me curious about the nuances and the small details and hints it got all over it. I just couldn't express the feelings I got watching this. In one word it's truly a masterpiece!

It Won 4 academy awards this year, and that's not a mean feat! Making history at the oscars by winning the best film award as a foreign film for the first time ever. It alone portrays how much this film has been applauded by the critics, the industry people and us ; the audience. This is one of those rare movies where majority of us have the same opinion about. It's entertaining, thrilling, with some dark twists and some disturbing scenes as well that will surely make an impact in your mind. I assure you ; this movie will be in your head for a very long period of time!

It brilliantly exposes the capitalism system in society that has been presented as the 'Parasite' in here. The class difference, the economical boundaries set by the same people. It does symbolise with every aspect of the core issues that every major society in the world currently faces. One thing That I absolutely loved about it was the simplistic way it took to handle those sensitive subjects. And it can be applicable to any country though it's been made having Korean culture and society in mind ; this story, would be relatable to everyone. No matter the country Someone lives in.

But you need to give your sincere focus and intellectuality while watching as it demands that. Every scene there has been crafted metaphorically. And those clever set ups can only be observed thoroughly if you are paying enough attention. Every character and their actions represent something. And you need to find that connection. And don't worry you will ; as the direction has been top notch throughout the entirety of the film. The character developments and The hidden metaphors are a treat to watch and experience.

My own personal tip would be to avoid every promo, trailer and articles before watching it. Going with a blank slate will help you to digest every bit of it naturally. Enough of the review now, I just wanna say, go and watch this film immediately. It's amazing and a surreal experience that could not be forgotten easily. Top of the table recommendation.","Feb 11, 2020"

10,Modern Classic.,"Review: 'Parasite' is a black comedy-thriller film directed by Bong Joon-ho. I personally love foreign films, especial horror and thriller films from South Korea. I have loved every movie I have seen thus far of director Bong Joon Ho's and this is no different. The film follows the members of a poor household scheming to become employees of a much wealthier family by posing as unrelated, highly qualified individuals. The actors in this movie bring their A-game and showcase all different levels on the screen. There are all able to showcase their comedic side as well as darker capabilities when needed. This is the rare occasion when there are no standouts because there are on the same level. Just brilliant performances all around. The story is so original and tightly executed. It may get a little confusing because things tend to happen quickly, and information can get lost. It is beautiful shot, this its camera angles and wide shots inside the house. It showcases different class types in society perfectly and how some rich look down on the poor and it gets under your skin. Overall, the movie is great for those who don't mind subtitles. However, if you do mind subtitles or have not tried foreign film, I promise you that you're missing out on a whole other world of cinema. I was going to give this movie 4.5 stars because I didn't just want to jump on the bandwagon with people loving this movie, but it deserves more than that. It is an absolutely flawless film. 5/5","Feb 3, 2020"
10,Holy Moly,"Out of 814 movies that I rated on this site, I only gave 9 of them the full 10/10 and this movie is one of them, so you go figure.","Dec 21, 2019"
10,Perfectly Done Political Satire,"PARASITE: The new Bong Joon-ho film that may be the best he's made and a hopeful contender for the best of the year.

First of, the dialogue is brilliant. With it constantly working on multiple levels, first making you understand and care about these characters, then learning dribs and drabs of their schemes and finally subtly setting up dialogue which is then brilliantly reincorporated to fuel emotional powerhouses of performances within the explosive finale. This is all whilst it being incredible natural and just out right human, there are so many instances of character inflection which tell you so much about each and every person on screen. Especially when some of the characters later in the film are playing characters themselves, lines here and there are clearly said by either themselves or the character they're pretending to be and because of their fantastic set-up, you're able to immediately tell when they're being themselves or not on the turn of a dime.

It manages to always perfectly balance it's comedic elements with the serious mystery thriller ones, always knowing exactly when and how to incorporate the two into the lives of the characters to create an amount of emotional connectivity to a film I haven't experience all year.

The political satire and themes on class struggle are too, fascinating, they're intrinsically baked into the narrative and backstory of the characters without ever being in your face or obnoxiously telling you what to think, so when they are brought up for a narrative beat or for you to get an emotional read on someone, you're free to interpret and analyse them as much or as little as you want.

Joon-Ho has at some points made the political ideologies a bit too apparent in his films which has come across as almost lecturous in Okja (2017) and Snowpiercer (2013). Thankfully this has never been detrimental to the final product, but I think the political statements within Parasite are here to create a better emotional connection to these characters, rather than blatantly tell you about the political climate you already know about.

By making you care about all these different and unique characters and using the political themes to set the stage for the story, when the themes on class struggle come to a head within the narrative you for one actually care about them because they're affecting character's you understand and like, and secondly they're then far more interesting to delve into and think about because the film never asked you too.

Even if you were to purely watch this without wanting to think about social satire, it's still an unbelievable film. It takes you on a mysterious thrill ride with some of the most interesting and unique characters put to screen this decade, the story goes to places you would never dream it would, and the soundtrack will be stuck in your head for days after you see it. It's a mile a minute masterpiece from one of the most exceptional auteur directors working today and was more than worthy of taking the Palme d'Or - 10/10","Aug 1, 2019"

'Oldboy', ""The Man From Nowhere"", ""I Saw The Devil"", ""The Chase"" etc. etc. You name it. Korean directors are masters when it comes to deliver messages about social taboo or to execute a thriller on screen in possibly the most perfect way. 'Parasite' adds and in fact stretches the legacy of Korean films in even broader perspective. Genres can be deceptive at times for some cinematic creations. And for films like 'Parasite', it spans over a wide sphere for sure. Kudos to the director Bong Joon-ho for giving this masterpiece which is multi-layered and shows the economic inequality in the pro-capitalist society of South Korea in a way which consists so much mixed emotions, sense of humour, lots of adrenaline rush, few nail-biting moments as well; all revolve around primarily two economically contrasting families. It pin-points out the drawbacks of extreme capitalism and plutocracy in its usual neo-noir black comic style, which will eventually grows on the minds of the audience. No wonder why this cinematic gem has got almost 10 mins of standing ovation at the Cannes and has won 4 Oscars at the 92nd Academy Awards including ""The Best Picture"" award as a Non-English film for the first time ever in the history of the Academy Awards.

Parasite keeps you interested from start to finish with great comedy, great characters, great twists & turns, great cinematography during the flood sequences and I especially enjoyed seeing the contrast between living standards in South Korea.

Gisaengchung (2019) (""Parasite"") is to simply put - the best South Korea'n movie i have ever seen. And i saw more then few of them and really loved them - i thing that this country makes best movies in Asia - in my personal opinion.

""Gisaengchung"" is nothing short of a small masterpiece. It is a stupendously entertaining movie that ""hooked"" me from the first 45 seconds till the last frame for its entire 2 h 9 min running time - i was blown away of how amazingly crafted, acted, written and directed this movie was in every scene. The story was fresh and unique and universal. You can throw a rock at me if Hollywood won't remake this movie with some very well known actors in near future - it is a pure diamond in a movie market.

Overall, ""Gisaengchung"" is by far one of the few best movies I've seen this year, right here along with ""Joker"" which i saw last week. It is unusually entertaining and involving story that shows of just how there are big differences in our society, between poor and rich.

The methodically cinematography and the clever use of sound effects and music makes every scene a work of art.

Parasite was amazing in the way that it was able to present twists and turns and shift genre and tone seamlessly. This film goes from pleasant comedy to a much darker film.

Parasite at its core is about economic class, family and the parasitical relationship between different members of society, and it does a hell of a job doing it. This film is one of the best movies coming out of 2019 and is sure to surprise audiences with a twist that is both horrifying and surprising.","Dec 23, 2019"

It is a critique of today's society, focused on having, on the immediate gratification, on the excesses for only a few people while we close our eyes to the inequality and poverty of many.

Its well deserved, the film won the Palme d'Or at the Cannes festival and the critic describes it as ""perfection made film"".

One individual comments that she never rides the subway. What is the significance of the below ground/above the surface boundary? Which domain affords the better social perspective?

10,This One is a Game-Changer,"In 2006, when I went to an art house movie theater, I saw Bong Joon Ho's campy but awesome sci-fi horror monster movie ""The Host."" I was only 16, but I made sure from then on I would see all the things he directs.

When he began getting so much praise and attention in 2019 for ""Parasite,"" I was a little worried. I wasn't a fan of ""Snowpiercer"" (although it is well crafted), and when he worked with Netflix in 2017 to direct ""Okja,"" I was even more disappointed.

But this afternoon, with my parents, I saw ""Parasite"" at Cinemark before the Oscars. As my previous review of it says, it is now one of my all time favorite films I've ever seen. I figured, however, given the Academy's fancy for war films, I just knew ""1917"" would take home the award for Best Motion Picture of the Year, and in all fairness, that was an amazing film. When Jane Fonda opened the envelope and stared for a moment, I was worried that the one film I wasn't terribly impressed with, ""Ford v. Ferrari,"" was the winner. Again, that was a technical feat for sure, but in my book it was the only one nominated for the best pic category that I felt it didn't deserve the win.

Jane Fonda, with surprised grandness (and obvious shock), announced that one word: ""Parasite."" There are many films that have won Best Picture that I've gushed over (remember my obsession with ""The Shape of Water""?), but this announcement made my heart leap with elation; that same sensation you get when your crush kisses your cheek and whispers ""I like you too.""

Bong Joon Ho...I am so happy for you.","Feb 10, 2020"

The film making is incredible, script writing is perfection! And the beautifully shot cinematography all blend together to create such a funny, sad and often tense story!","Mar 1, 2020"
10,Exceeds every expectation,"I read a lot of rave reviews about this before I saw it. I also saw it on many ""must see"" lists the past month, so I thought, alright I'll watch it, and approached it with a ""show me what you got"" kind of attitude. It didn't take long before I realized that I was watching something incredibly different. In fact It is incomparable with anything I've ever seen before. It belongs and at the same time doesn't fit in in any kind of genre. It is as thrilling as the best parts of Gone Girl and is everything Jordan Peele's Us tried to be. I would say that this is the most divine work of cinema I've seen in many many years.

Some people refrain from watching foreign language films. I find myself paying more attention to the plot since I have to read what is being said. This is very beneficial to a film that demands your attention at every single moment, which this one does.

Parasite deserves a 10/10 because of the very simple reason that I wouldn't want to change a single second of it, everything had purpose. So watch it, I bet it will exceed any expectation you might have from reading all of these reviews.","Jan 2, 2020"
10,"""Unveiling the Layers of 'Parasite': A Cinematic Gem That Redefines Genre Boundaries""","""Parasite,"" Bong Joon-ho's masterful dissection of social stratification, unfolds with the precision of a surgeon and the craft of a great storyteller. It is a film that defies genre, blending comedy, tragedy, and a thriller into a symphony of cinematic elements that harmonize into an unforgettable experience.

The film begins innocuously enough, with the Kim family, a quartet of lovable rogues, struggling to make ends meet in their semi-basement apartment. Their lives are a series of small hustles, folding pizza boxes for meager wages while they leech off the Wi-Fi of nearby businesses. It's a life of squalor, yet depicted with a warmth that endears us to the Kims from the outset.

When Ki-woo, the son, is given the opportunity to tutor for the wealthy Park family, the film shifts gears. The Parks live in an architectural marvel of a home, a stark contrast to the cramped quarters of the Kims. It's not just a different dwelling; it's a different world. The lush lawns, the sterile spaciousness, the casual opulence - it all speaks of a life unattainable for the Kims, until they begin to insinuate themselves into the Parks' household.

What follows is a series of cons and deceptions, each more audacious than the last, as the Kims slowly infiltrate the Parks' lives. There's a delicious tension in watching the Kims weave their web, a sense of giddy anticipation as each new lie is told, each new scheme is hatched. Yet, there's an underlying pathos too, a commentary on the desperation that drives the Kims to such lengths.

Bong Joon-ho's direction is impeccable. He navigates the tonal shifts with a deft hand, ensuring that the humor never undermines the tension, and the suspense never overshadows the film's social commentary. The cinematography is equally adept, with shots that linger just long enough to let the unease set in, or quick cuts that heighten the absurdity of a situation.

The performances are stellar across the board. Song Kang-ho, as the patriarch of the Kim family, brings a weary charm to his role. He's a man beaten down by life but not broken, and there's a twinkle in his eye that suggests he's in on the joke. Cho Yeo-jeong, as the Park family matriarch, is wonderfully naive, a woman so insulated by wealth that she's blind to the realities of the world around her.

""Parasite"" is a commentary on the human condition, a reflection on the lengths to which people will go to climb out of the pits of poverty. It's a film that holds a mirror up to society, forcing us to confront the uncomfortable truths about the world we live in.

""Parasite"" is not just a film; it's a cultural moment, a piece of art that transcends its medium to become something more. It's a film that challenges, entertains, and enlightens, a rare gem that shines with the brilliance of a well-cut diamond. It's a film that deserves to be seen, discussed, and remembered, a testament to the power of cinema to reflect and reshape our world.

In crafting ""Parasite,"" Bong Joon-ho has not only created a film that is a technical marvel, but also one that is profoundly human. It's a film that speaks to the heart and the mind, a film that, like the best of art, changes those who experience it. It's a film that, without a doubt, stands as a towering achievement in the landscape of modern cinema.","May 28, 2024"
10,A different kind of infestation,"A Korean film that seemingly sweeping up at the awards seasons? It can't be that good, can it!? Did the judges not see 1917! Is what I hear you cry as you even read the title of this review. From the mind of Bong Joon-ho comes a drama about class and home invasion, but truly can it be THAT good? Lest we forget this is the mind behind the uncompromising vision of Snowpericer and the unsettling onslaught that was Okaj... but even still, it can't be better than Joker? Right?

There is a surreal kind of desperation that follows you while watching Parasite, you want to see the ultimate fate of our protagonist sooner than is given. The real tilting point of the movie comes around the halfway mark when a troubling discovery is made, this propels the film from contemporary melodrama into an all-out descent into madness, this is where Bong Joon-ho thrives. In the chaos, in the distress, this is where Bong Joon-ho forces us as an audience to be.

Parasite has a rare kind of delicacy to it as if Bong Joon-ho doesn't want to upset us too much, but what's to keep us unsettled. He wants to make us dread for the next turn of events, and as the final curtain falls, you know you have just seen a masterpiece. However, I am unsure if this would not be better suited to a stage production rather than the grandiose of a film.

The movie has nothing in it which makes me feel like it must be seen at a cinema, but perhaps that is to its ultimate asset. A film that transcends how you view it and is outstanding on its own merits.

The most adequate comparison I can make for Parasite is a Shakespearean play. The film has moments of levity and comedy, blended in with horrible and tragic scenes, and is divided into acts. It has deep pathos and there is something overall cathartic about the whole experience.

This is the first film of Bong Joon-ho's that is set in a reality which is current and we (as the viewer) inhabit, despite this, there is still a surreal and other world quality to the proceedings, not unlike Alice In Wonderland. Bong Joon-Ho beckons us through the looking glass.

Perhaps Parasite's strongest suit is its characters who are exceptionally well balanced, there is nothing as obvious as a villain or hero in Parasite. No, the film leaves this up to us, as the viewer to pick out who we feel was correct in their actions most. Make no mistake Parasite's is a world filled with fallen humans. To make such deep characters takes a lot of talent and each of the actors give performances that could have easily lead to their own awards nominations.

Parasite is a true master class in film making, while totally different from everything else on the market, genre and even world it might just deserve all of the awards it's getting. Yes, even THAT one.

10,"When life gives lemons , watch Parasite","A movie that has an entertaining story in the surface and deep meanings as you dive in.

The director played it safe by introducing a simple story and gave it a god-tier build up with twisted plot. This is brilliant , you don't have to complicate it in order to get audience attention.

I am sure people will diverge and make speculations about the ending , and will never forget this movie as they live.","Dec 24, 2019"
10,Such an achievement,This was a wonderful film and I enjoyed absolutely everything about it. It's thought provoking and the story of a poor family wanting a better life isn't new but this particular concept is just amazing. I will be thinking about these people for a very long time. I can't wait to watch it all again. Loved it. Loved it. Loved it,"Feb 5, 2020"
10,A Masterpiece!,I love movies that criticize society and its different classes. This film combines humor and darkness and shows life from different perspectives. Love it!!,"Jan 10, 2020"
10,Have you got a plan?,"No plan is the (best) plan. No position is final. Every life is there to improvise, when the chance is. No fixed values, don't fool yourself. No fixed position (though, society place their limits - or gives opportunities) - it all can change unexpectedly at any given moment. No main roles - each life is a role in itself. So - what's the value? Well, whatever conservative it may sound (especially for a motion-picture like this one) - family values. That's your opportunities, your backup - add some lottery and improvisation - life depicted. Lot of points to the story told (and how), and to actors' play. Lots of points to all the different prospectives - as you see the unrolling event from all the eyes of all the engaged persons (it is a value that many of today RPG have - you can play as any of persons involved - and see from their point of view - and feel their values). I wouldn't call it a drama, neither a ""social comedy"" though. It isn't a detective story either. It's a very talented director's work, play-writer's as well (ah, he's the same one...). It's an amazing cast. And it's more than fairly valued/rewarded - with the ""golden palm"" and a lot of ""oscars"" (despite critics' grumble - what so many ""oscars"" given for...). That one surely goes into a world cinematic library - to be a modern classic.","Feb 12, 2020"
10,Brilliant,"I reserve 10 stars for only the cream of the crop, and I can safely say after one viewing that this was just that.

Masterfully done in every aspect. All of the acting, camerawork, and design was fitting and never over the top.

The plot was wonderfully paced and the organic tension created was very effective. Furthermore, this movie had much to say thematically and did a incredible job conveying those thematic elements while staying within itself.

I don't want to spoil even the slightest minor detail so that every viewer can enjoy this movie; as we are all only lucky enough to experience one so brilliant every five years or so. All I would advise is that you do see it, and for those of you averse to foreign films, don't let it impede you. It truly is the finest movie I've seen in recent memory. You'll forget it was in Korean.","Nov 2, 2019"
10,Up and down the ladders,"Some stories are plain and simple, a line from A to B. Some are convoluted mindgame mazes that force you to solve riddles or to stay forever lost. And then there's this film. A traditional Asian gift of layers upon layers of wrapping, each concealing and disguising not just the shape but the essence of what's inside. And in the end, the gift might not be what's in there, but the act of unwrapping itself.

I'm amazed how Bong Joon Ho tricks us into believing that this is a cheap con artist comedy at first. It was almost natural to shout ""No way! This can't be the film everyone's raving about!"". Had I recalled that this man has also written Snowpiercer, I would not have been so simple. Just like the rich family whose house the parasites have invaded, naive and gullible, ready to call the number on the first business card given, we fall into the traps of easy interpretations, and Bong knows it well enough, giving us all these hints we understand only after a while.

Parasite is definitely not about the action, and maybe not even about the visual brilliance, although the scene of running down the stairs, equally physical, social and psychological, under the rain is a phenomenally executed message, just like a scene of an elevated toilet bowl regurgitating back what it's fed up taking in is an image only a person who made two Oscars kiss could come up with. In terms of graphic expression and witty dialogues, Parasite could make both Tarantino and Miyazaki proud, all at the same time.

This is no doubt a fancy wrapping, but the best thing about this film is what you feel through it. From condescending disbelief, to light interest, to full engagement, to the sense of watching a social message play within a movie, to feeling as if no borders of genre or common sense exist at all, to feeling dumbfounded and uncomfortable, to a sudden calm. As if a petty half-penny story has taken you into a Zen parable.

In the end, nothing remains. An experience that leaves you blank as a mountain side under the snow. So if you do see a light in the distance, don't rush to decode its signals. Just enjoy the scenery while it lasts. After all, it's what you came all the way up for.","Apr 19, 2020"

It's about a low income family who deceives a wealthy family into hiring them - and soon the low income family weeds into the wealthy family's lives and begins to take complete control over them. But all is not what it seems - as the wealthy family's house harbors a dark secret. The script is excellent.

It's a slow rise to disconcerting, uncomfortable, and then all of the sudden, it is disturbing and gory and... insane.

10,Polished and Masterful,"The working class and down on their luck Kim family struggle to make ends meet. When a friend of the son, Ki-Woo's, who is an English tutor for the daughter in the wealthy Park family, has to leave his position, he recommends Ki-Woo for the job. Now having an ""in"" with the wealthy family, the Kims begin plotting the downfall of the current household servants and inserting themselves into those vacant positions, making them all gainfully employed and with money finally flowing into the household. But not everything is as it seems in the Park house or with their previous servants.

This movie starts out as a comedy and quickly goes into social commentary, pointing out the differences between the poor working class family and the wealthy privileged family. The differences are ones that get commonly pointed out with the well-to-do having what usually gets termed as first-world-problems, while the poor family is literally trying to survive and save meager possessions in a flood. It doesn't shy away or try to be subtle about it, but interestingly enough, we don't feel beaten over the head with it either, which is a major change from the ham-fisted approach taken by most filmmakers. Couching this in a comedy is a good approach, as well, as the audience's guard is let down and we become more receptive to the ideas.

However, I do say it's MOSTLY a comedy. The third act takes a dark, dark turn, and the contrast, not to mention general disdain and even indifference, between the classes becomes much more severe. This gets into some hard territory, and characters that we've found quirky and even come to like in some ways show very different sides of themselves. At the same time, it doesn't feel unexpected, almost like we could tell that this was under the surface all the time and tried to ignore it, but aren't surprised by it when it does show up. This is some masterful characterization!

Another aspect of note is that this film is rich in allegory and metaphor. It's a smart film, yet at the same time the filmmakers are not condescending about it. They give the audience credit for being able to understand the symbolism and don't spoon feed you everything, which is a refreshing change from the usual head-beating most filmmakers go for. At the same time, they understand that not every audience member will understand or immediately pick up on every symbol, but they have crafted this so carefully and so perfectly that you don't have to understand each and every one. That understanding merely enriches the experience, but isn't essential to it.

This film has gotten some recognition, and deservedly so. It is rich, intelligent, and polished to a degree that we sadly don't see as often as we should nowadays, showing the filmmakers are masters of their craft. This is easily one of the best films I've seen in 2019. Highly recommended!","Oct 19, 2019"

10,Parasite,"Joon-Ho Bong is a true master of story telling. The concept of Parasite is tremendously original, yet feels simple and close to life, and as the story progresses, unexpected twists and imagination are around every corner. The entire film is well chiseled in every aspect. The use of color and the overall cinematography/editing of the film is top class not just for an Asian film, but for any Hollywood blockbusters. Pairing Bong with the strong cast also makes the film a no-doubter masterpiece. At the end of the day, the colorful group of characters are what will be remembered the most, each and every one of them is worth savoring and are honestly beautifully crafted. Bong is also able to illustrate the inner psyche of class difference in Asian societies, where class discrepancy is wide and is one of the most significant social issue. The film is able to dive into this through a creative story that perhaps wouldn't exist anywhere else in the world, and could be food for thought for both spectrums of the scale.","Jul 25, 2019"
10,Overwhelming as hell,"Movie starts off with a very intimate portrayal of the poverty and the vigor of the first family. Mastery is very evident.

The rich family is portrayed next with just as much intimacy and depth.

The story starts unfolding, the deviousness is a bit disturbing when it begins. Intimate portrayal is about showing everything, not just the stuff that gets the audience to like the protagonists. Bong Joon Ho is ruthless in his script and making.

The excesses of the rich is contrasted sharply with the abysses of the poor.

There is so much to this movie that the various departments of the movie like cinematography, music etc don't make it to the plane of consideration on the review table. Shocking movie. Must watch. Amazing content, amazing execution!","Jan 27, 2020"
10,This is true cinema: When everything is just perfect.,"If you like cinema, dont miss this movie.

At last, ill been waiting so many years for a movie like this: a beautiful, powerful and great history who touch all the film genres, and do it SO well. Parasite is an awesone thriller who break with a lot of spin and turns a masterpiece script.

A director in state of grace talks about almost everything: the most inhuman capitalism, how the middle class just dissapear, an amazing tale about the life and death, about the dreams that grow and dies, about you cant runaway for who you really are, and the great hole between the human being.

Is better just go and see this movie with no idea about what it goes. Its the greatest film you see for decades. Believe me. ""Dont do any plans. Life dont go this way""","Jan 8, 2020"
10,Well deserved,"Just watched this film yesterday, really love this story. And surprised the academy even knowledged it.😳","Feb 10, 2020"
10,"Explosive crime and class warfare film, funny and suspenseful","Bong Joon Ho's film about an impoverished family of petty criminals in Korea is full of menacing, mischievous energy and spiked with sharply-drawn characters, with varying shades of moral and ethical decay. It's a rare film you will remember for its sheer personality and exciting twists and turns.

It's best to go into this film knowing as little as possible. The family of con artists sees its fortunes take a turn when one day the son by pure chance gains access to the residence of a super wealthy family. The rest should be found out on screen as this film proceeds at a visceral pace and never misses at beat.

Performances are strong all around but the father of the family of criminals is brilliantly portrayed by Song Kang-ho, as he embodies all the boldness and fears of a devoted parent who will do anything to provide for his family, however shady and immoral his choices become. He also exemplifies the steadfast defiance of a working class man who refuses to be held down by those more powerful. The rock of the family, he is one of the most likeable protagonists ever.

For all the vitality and edginess of this film, there is also a residual melancholy feel to the story. Through all the bitter class struggle and criminal audacity at work here, there remains a lingering shred of human dignity. Grandly recommended.","Nov 15, 2019"
10,AMAZING IT'S INSANE,"This is my first ever review. I saw it with my sister at the movie theatre. I never wanted to know anything about the movie in before hand and I've scouted the movie for a long time. Among the best movies I've ever seen. We were both laughing many times, even the slap stick could be funny. I had real hand sweat during scenes. The filming techniques are superb and a scene fade I've never seen before, gave me goosebumps. I like all the characters. Even though they are disgusting. I will see it again, Korean movies is something else, I love them.","Feb 2, 2020"
10,Parasite as a social landscape,"Parasite is a one of the kind film, analyzing the relationships of power between people, social and economic classes and also between genres. The director was capable of camouflage such critics even within the urban landscape, creating political and social spaces that differ and are affected differently. There are subtle nuances of how climatic circumstances are seen and felt by the different spectrums of social classes. Parasite's narrative and visual language achieves a tremendous sensation on the spectator, a sensation of social verticality.","Feb 13, 2020"
10,One of the best films of the year as well as Bong Joon Ho's career,"Parasite is written and directed by Bong Joon Ho (Memories Of murder, The Host, Snowpiercer) and tells the story of a poor family living In Korea who take particular interest in a wealthy family as they slowly integrate themselves into there lives. Thats the basic/general premise for Parasite, and don't look anything else up about this movie beacuse make no mistake, this is a movie best experienced by knowing as little as possible, it also just so happens to be one of, if not the best movie of the entire year aswell as Bong Joon Ho's entire career.

Where to even begin with this one. Well let's start with the director himself. Ive always been a huge fan of Bong Joon Ho's. The Host is one of my favourite monster movies and Snowpiercer is a fun ride aswell, however it's Memories of Murder that really impressed me. A perfectly constructed crime thriller which put Ho on the map. Ho is a extremely ambitious and confident filmmaker who seems to be always trying something new with every movie he makes. One thing that always strikes me and many other fans of Bong's work is the overall tone of his films. Just like his previous work parasite is really difficult to place into just one genre. At times it extremely funny and playful, the next minute it will be an nail biting thriller with a hint of horror. Bongs writing style is something that I have always enjoyed but here in particular It works extremely well.

My favourite aspect of this movie (Besides basically everything) is the characters and the writing. Parasite is a movie that is examing social classes and showing the divide for what it truly is, in the film we see perspectives from both poor and rich families. With that in mind you may have some preconception of how these families are going to be shown based on what you have seen in the past. However you would be wrong. Ho manages to show both families with the same amount of respect as each other. His not trying to make the rich looks evil but at the same time not trying to make the poor look like saints. He is just showing human beings and the effect that these social class divides take on us. One thing that Bong Joon Ho said in the Q&A after the screening that struck me was: ""There are no Villains in this film"" and it's true. This all lends itself to a truly unique experience where you understand every characters motivations and understand the actions that they take, and in turn practically don't necessarily know who you want to come out on top.

Just go support this movie if you get the chance. Especially if you are a fan of film as an art form. Beacuse this truly is a masterful put together movie that from the second it starts to the end had me transfixed.","Dec 15, 2019"
10,PERFECT MOVIE! It has EVERYTHING! Don't Miss,"WOW! I had no idea what to expect from this movie but it was fantastic! The acting was top-notch, there were laughs, dramatic moments, scary ones too. I was on the edge of my seat throughout the film. Don't Miss this brilliant movie!","Feb 10, 2020"
10,This movie has everything,"As someone who has found themselves watching more foreign films than English speaking ones following the release of squid game, this is the best foreign film I've ever seen. It has everything that you could want in a film. It has comedy, likable characters, brilliant writing, great music, INCREDIBLE set design, heartfelt moments, and even touches on modern issues like socioeconomic status.

Most years that I follow the academy awards, I always found myself thinking that the best picture winner is a bit too abstract for my taste (shape of water), but this is absolutely not. It's nuanced without being too direct, and massively entertaining. I expected a boring but insightful watch, and was massively thrown for a loop.

Although there was some grimness, it's not a horror flick, but a psychological thriller. The film paints with grandiose broad strokes using extravagance to tell a bigger story...a story about social inequality and the gullibility of people, particularly entitled acting rich foks. The story crawls into your mind and leaves you pondering.

It blends comedy, suspense, family, and a little romance in a beautiful way into a brutal commentary of class and society. I'd love to say more but it's better going into it knowing nothing about it so I'll leave it at that.

10,No wonder this gem got almost 10 mins standing ovation at Cannes.,"Oh man, what can I say... How do I describe this jaw-dropping masterpiece in just few sentences?

PARASITE (not mistaken with that outstanding anime 'Parasyte') is a socially conscious themed film that masterfully wrapped in comedy and thriller. It's an exciting and surprising ride from start to finish. The tone shifting in the second part of the film is done brilliantly. Eventhough there's so much stuff happening, Bong didn't lose control of his storytelling.

Most of the scenes are sure very relatable for many in real life. On top of that, the ensemble cast (featuring my favorite Song Kang Ho) deliver a top notch Oscar-worthy performance.

PARASITE is the worthy winner of this year Palme d'Or (and I also hope it will do well at the Oscar - Best Picture worthy? for sure!)

It's the best film of the year, one of the best I've seen in this decade and for me it's arguably one of all time classic.","Jun 27, 2019"

If, on the other hand, you want to see a film that will make you think and reevaluate your view on modern human society, it is a must see for you.","Oct 27, 2019"
10,The trailer doesnt give it any motivation to watch,"But its a must watch movie , amazing. In the middle it gets predictable and then get better and more suspense u stay at the edge of ur seat.","Aug 3, 2021"
10,The very best movie of the decade.,"This film is such a perfect masterpiece in every facet that one cannot be but astounded and has become interested in everything Korean. I am in love with Korean language, with its sweet words-enunciation, the cadence, the soft and musical ending of every sentence. However,the less one read about the movie beforevwatchng it, the better. Go and see it, you won't regret","Feb 10, 2020"
10,"Hits Every Mark It Sets For Itself, And Falls Into None Of The Possible Traps. Justly Celebrated.","Metaphors can be a problem in any piece of storytelling if the creator becomes so wedded to the metaphor that it al becomes either too obvious or too forced, and the narrative collapses under the weight of the meaning being attached to it. Simply describing the central metaphor of Parasite in the way it speaks to the film's theme of the rich-poor divide might make it seem that it's obvious, but it works deliciously. The plot is all sleek, smooth lines akin to the architecture of the house in which most of the film takes places; the metaphor is easy to grasp but never simplistic. Indeed this is one of those rare works of art that neither romanticises the poor nor demonises the rich, and it goes even better by excusing no one from their sins. It also switches genres deftly; from the delicate comedy of the first hour to the comedic drama/thriller of the second half. Other genre tropes are cleverly employed - especially hinting at aspects of horror and science-fiction, nodding more than once to HG Wells' War Of The Worlds amongst others. The film moves gracefully to a conclusion that's startling and that also seems somehow written in the stars; in the hands of an inferior artist it would be schlocky and clumsy; here it simply works as it's intended to. Similarly, the film's epilogue avoids sentimentality and manages to pack an emotional punch. That the film achieves all this within a seamless whole that is at once perfectly constructed but still humane and truthful is the reason is this film is so justly celebrated.","Jul 21, 2020"
10,"Funny, light, thoughtful, deep, suspenseful, dark, all the things","Funny, light, thoughtful, deep, suspenseful, dark, all the things

Very intelligent film that weaves together many different perspectives and tones masterfully. Several different levels to think about and discuss with others. It will leave you thinking about it for days afterward just to ponder it a bit more. Definitely tell your friends to watch it because you'll want someone to discuss it with. This is a full-course dinner that leaves you perfectly satisfied :)","May 7, 2020"
10,The merits of a metaphorical meritocracy,"I want to say so much about this powerful movie but it is clear from the scores and reviews it is compelling, thought-provoking and subtly absorbing.

Suffice to say it's a must watch for anyone who is intreagued by the class decides and struggles of society perfectly framed in a culture of academically hungry people.

This beautiful movie crosses many genres and does a fantabulous job of letting you be thoroughly taken into the lives of each character without any judgement to their respective plights.

I am left with a silent revilaey that hard work can be a poisoned chalis if it has no real meaning, as much as luck and wealth can leave you unfulfilled if you don't look down with compassion.

Or was it all just a metaphor? If so, what for? I, for one, don't care.","Jan 26, 2020"
10,the hype,"I love Breaking Bad. I watched the entirety of it three times. But at the first go, it took getting to season 4, episode 11 (Crawl Space) for my mind to go numb from the intensity, and to season 5, episode 14 (Ozymandias) for it to crumble. That is how long it took me to understand the hype.

Parasite did it in less than 2 hours.","Mar 4, 2020"
10,Lives up to the universal praise.,"Parasite tells the story of a poor family in South Korea. Kim Ki-taek(Kang-ho Song), his wife Kim Chung-sook(Hye-jin Jang), son Kim Ki-woo(Woo-sik Choi) & daughter Kim Ki-jung(So-dam Park), start working for the super rich Park family. Soon, things start getting complicated.

Parasite is a jaw-dropping film. Director Bong Joon Ho has given us another unforgettable movie, after The Host(2006), Snowpiercer(2013) & Okja(2017). Parasite has so many levels & nuances to it. This film, makes you experience a whirlwind of emotions. You'll laugh, you'll be on the edge of your seat, you'll be shocked, you'll be teary-eyed & you will be left ruminating about the movie, long after the credits roll. The performances are mind-blowing. Kang-ho Song is spectacular as Kim Ki-taek. Sun-kyun Lee is brilliant as Park Dong-ik. Yeo-jeong Jo is amazing as Park Yeon-kyo. Woo-sik Choi is outstanding as Kim Ki-woo. So-dam Park is fantastic as Kim Ki-jung. Jeong-eun Lee is excellent as Moon-gwang. Hye-jin Jang is awesome as Kim Chung-sook. Ji-so Jung is great as Park Da-hye. Myeong-hoon Park is superb as Geun-se. The supporting cast is memorable. Parasite is a must watch. It deserves all the awards it has received so far & deserves its six Oscar nominations. Definitely one of the best films of the year, whether it's English, Korean or any other language!","Feb 4, 2020"
10,A Film of Which I Haven't Seen The Likes Of,"Tuesday afternoon. Summer is coming to a close. I hear that the local independent cinema is showing the new film 'Parasite' that has been getting tons of hype. Whats all the fuss about? Well let me tell you.

Cinema was packed. Opening Credits, then the movie begins until the final credits at which point the movie had ended.

Final reflections: This movie does not fit into a genre. It feels totally fresh and has comedic moments which landed with the audience in the room whilst exploring much darker themes and moments. The cinematography is beautiful and innovative and is a great palette and paintbrush for the social commentary that exists in the movie. The casting is brilliant and the dynamics that exist between the characters is entirely believable.","May 15, 2021"
10,The Best Film in Years.,"Maybe it's just me, but I have known a decline in film quality since 2017. 2016 was a very good year for film--the last great year altogether. Have I simply seen too many films? In 2016 and earlier, There were a whole bunch of films that I could say ""now that is one of the very best films I have ever seen."" Since 2017, the most that I could say about I film I love would have been ""I love this film. But I don't adore it...One of the best of the year, not ever."" Finally near the end of the decade comes a film I can comfortably say is one of the finest motion pictures I have ever laid eyes on.

The movie is Korean so there are subtitles and it does run over two hours. But throughout that duration, time stands still. We are fully immersed in this tale of Shakespearean portions and Hitchcockian brains.

'Parasite' follows two families: the dirt poor Kims and the filthy rich Parks. Being on opposite ends of the social spectrum, many people interpret this as a social satirical film. I can see where they are coming from, but I didn't care about that. Many different themes such as identity are also looked at, but that is all just icing on the cake. Placing them on opposite ends of the spectrum just makes the story and characters another relationships all the more great.

it is sad seeing the Kims in such bad living conditions, so we root for them right away to get out of the slums. Ki-woo is the son who aspires to get out of poverty by attending university. He is approached by one of his university friends who is going overseas to study to take over tutoring Park Da-hye in english. Ki-woo does not know English well, but figures he can fake it and make some money. he may be just a tutor, but it pays well. He finds out that the Parks are looking for a therapist for their son, so Ki-woo gets his sister to assume a new identity and be the boy's therapist. With more money coming and only two more people in the Kim family in need of a good job, it all seems like a sinch to get them in. But getting rid of people in their way and keeping their true identities under wraps from the Parks will be harder than they could fathom.

'Parasite' could be simplified as ""family vs family"" but there are a couple of more characters other than the regular family members that are all so interesting. Most movies cannot handle developing these many characters. They are smart, sympathetic, even likeable.

The reason I call this film ""Hitchcockian"" is because of its power to thrill us and take the viewer to places they could never imagine. Even when a movie is unpredictable, the payoffs are plausible and the viewer is able to tie things together easily. But with this, each time a twist comes (which is frequent) the viewer is still left flabbergasted and completely caught off guard. The director really pulls out the rug from underneath.

Watching this movie was such a breath of fresh air and director, Bong Joon-Ho could easily have messed up at any moment. But there is not one second of wasted or subpar material. In fact, it it just the opposite: the movie keeps building and just gets better by the minute. The thrills get stronger and stronger as the twists get smarter and more intricate. With all that happens 'Parasite' becomes an imservie film experience that you will never forget.

4/4","Nov 14, 2019"
10,A devilishly delicious and twisted tale of class dynamics,"After hearing so praise much about Bong Joon-ho's latest film when it premiered at the Cannes film festival this year, I went in not trying to know too much about it. And it definitely lived up to the hype.

The Kim family struggles to get by as the father, Ki-taek (Song Kang-ho), is unemployed and are forced to live in run-down basement apartment in an already poor neighbourhood. Conning and manipulation is second nature to the family as it is their only means to ensure they come close to living. And once the opportunity comes in the form of the wealthy Park family needing a new English teacher for their teenage daughter, the Kim's young adult son Ki-woo (Choi Woo-shik) takes the position to help his family get the money they need to escape their impoverished lifestyle. Through a series of planned and highly calculated manipulation and trickery, Ki-woo gets all of his family members employed but at the expense of getting the Park's previous driver and housemaid fired to steal their paid positions. Eventually the Kim's start living off the of the Parks's luxuries as if they entered the gates of heaven and awarded for their scheme.

To explain anything more would ruin the rest of the story. The joy of it will be watching the twists unfold as the ideas and themes of Parasite take on a very unique and unexpected look at the class dynamic. The film portrays neither families as the hero or villain of this story. Similar to his English-language sci-fi thriller Snowpiercer, Bong Joon-ho dives deep into a surreal, abstract world to explore the class dynamic between the wealthy and the poor. The difference in this being neither side is worth rooting for nor against. The Kim's take advantage of the Parks's naivety through their con as the most sure-fire way to gain the benefits that are denied to them because of their class status. And so it means they are ignorant to the moral consequences made by their scam until it is too late. Meanwhile, the Parks are so condition to their wealthy and privileged lifestyle they are oblivious to how unfair they treat the lower class while being paranoid and frightened by what doesn't meet their high expectations. The cruel unexpected circumstances of the film's events prove no matter how well planned things go, the poor will still in the end be feeding off the scraps of the rich that blindly ignore them.

Don't want to say anything much else about Parasite other then it is worth seeing without not much else about it. Go see it.","Oct 25, 2019"
10,Genius Bong Joon-ho is back,"Finally we have another all-Korean movie from the master.

Bong Joon-ho is back and is unpredictable as always.

Let me give you 5 reasons to watch this movie:

1) You love a good crime/drama/thriller.

2) You love Korean cinema with all your heart.

3) You love Song Kang-ho (how one can not love him?)

4) The script, acting and directing are perfect (as always when the Master is in business).

Welcome :)","Aug 8, 2019"
10,This movie creates a sense of unease like no other,"Throughout the whole movie i felt panic build up internally. This movie creates a feeling through the whole runtime that makes you want to turn it of to spare yourself. At the same time it grips you so tightly and you can't pull yourself away. In a decade or two we will look back at this movie in the same way we look back at ""Silence of the Lambs"" and such films. A true 10/10.","Jul 14, 2021"
10,The set up was great,"The producing and directing was just brilliant. I can't believe how good the cinematography of this to film is. Everyone, every thing, every shot is a brilliant artwork. I watch it and then rewatch it the day after late at night. I absolutely love this movie. It has been over a year since this film won best picture. I still haven't recovered from the excitement I felt when Parasite cleaned house at the Academy Awards. Absolutely breathtaking.","May 20, 2022"

I don't want to spoil anything but WATCH IT!!","Feb 9, 2020"
10,OMG...must watch!,"First and foremost, this movie is a must watch! It starts funny, becomes interesting, and then holy ****! The writing, directing, cinematography, and acting are all masterclass. To sum this movie in a few words I would say it's a dark comedy tragedy(if such a thing exists). Also, if you see this movie and want more check out the director's other movies that are also great; Snowpiercer, Mother, and Okja. Most of his movies, including Parasite, are about the classes we fall under and even though we may be from the same country, same race, whatever, we still see each other so differently because of this.","Nov 28, 2019"
10,"Deserving of best picture, beautiful on many levels, eyes and mouth wide open throughout","Partly because i had to read the movie. No but seriously, wow, one of those movies that you just never want to end. So many things about this movie that is pleasing. From beginning to end, the movie is absolutely jam packed with stimulation. Deception, violence, unpredictability, bits of arousal, cultural reference, so much comedy, and an ending that definitely does not disappoint. From 1/8th in until the end, you'll just constantly be saying OMG. This movie was definitely deserving of best picture, perhaps even one of the best of the decade. I saw this about a week after I saw Joker, which was also amazing, and similarly disturbing. However, Parasite is just a masterpiece.","Mar 18, 2020"
10,Whats that smell?,"Often you can look at the awards given to a film and upon watching it wonder who gave large bags of cash to whom? In the case of Parasite, every good thing that has been said about this movie is true! Engaging, dramatic, funny, tragic, original and more. Congratulations to all those involved :)","Aug 22, 2020"
10,I love this movie!,"Oh man so I love this movie. Beautifully shot and exquisitely acted. Parasite is funny, tugs at the heart strings and is super dark just like I like my films. The director Bong Joon-ho has delivered yet again. I'm in on everything thing else he makes. Go see this movie in the theaters while you can and if you miss it, definitely watch it when it's streaming you won't be disappointed. Parasite is a 10🙏🏻","Nov 2, 2019"
10,Mind-blowing edge of your seat storytelling,"Such a precise way of unfolding a story, every frame is captivating. Tells the story of social divide in a truly masterful metaphorical thriller with such craft that you can't take your eyes off any single character. Altogether a hitchcokian tale that keeps surprising you with every scene until it's inevitable and explosive third act. I'm in awe of this film.","Jan 3, 2020"
10,It's got it all,"Do Not Let The Subtitles put you off, after about 20 minutes, perhaps just after the pizza boxes your in, Didn't think I was going to be watching a film that would end up being my 7th favourite ever film, Considering I've watched very few Subtitled films, this has it all, Crime, Comedy. Thriller.

South Korean and it's my number 6 film! I won't ever forget those outside stairs :) it really has got it all ergo why I gave it 9 stars. But I'd give it 9.5 if i could as it's my best 9/10 film

I don't think this film would work in many other countries. Song Kang-ho who plays Ki Taek is superb as the main man. I left this 4 years after my family told me to watch it because of subtitles, don't you do the same!","Mar 25, 2024"
10,Best plan is not having one,This is a great Korean little gem. The storyline is simply amazing and I suggest not read anything before you watch it. I did it and I have enjoyed every single minute of the movie. Best plan is not having one.,"Sep 3, 2019"
10,"Fascinating mix of dark comedy, drama and thriller","It's been a while since I watched a movie that made such impact on me. First of all, I really liked the story of different social classes, despair, greed, deception, pride and prejudices. It is masterfully directed by Bong, carefully navigating through a scenario full of twists and unexpected turns. Dialogues are funny and there is good characterization making characters complexed and intriguing. Parasite can't be categorized in a specific movie genre, rather it's a mix of dark comedy, drama and thriller which is it's strong feature because there are not so many movies who can balance so well between those genres. This is movie that I will gladly watch many times. A real gem of Korean cinematography.","Feb 2, 2020"

10,Crossing the line,"PARASITE is that rare movie that works for both cinephiles and an audience seeking nothing more than an entertaining two hours. For me, this is the best sort of movie, giving the audience both food for thought and a great time. Twisty, intelligent, and often laugh-out-loud funny, PARASITE is a movie that mixes and matches every genre from comedy to horror. It's beautifully shot and acted, definitely one of the best films to come out of 2019. Though it deals with South Korean society, its themes regarding the widening socioeconomic gap and the class-based prejudices which linger in our modern world are universal.","May 5, 2020"
10,Certainly Masterful Filmmaking,No spoilers in this review. I hope that every film buff sees this wonderful piece of art. Not often does a filmmaker pull off this amount of creativity. Bravo!,"Apr 13, 2020"

10,Best movie of the 2010s!,"Fascinating cinema that highlights how emotionally detached wealthy people can be. So many profound messages as it pertains to classism. Unexpected plot twists and all. I loved, loved, loved this movie.","Feb 3, 2020"
10,A masterpiece,"What can I say, I'll keep it quick.

1. I knew within a few minutes this film was going to be excellent, we all have that feeling when we know if something is going to be exceptional.

2. Some of the dialogue was so hilarious I was literally crying with laughter, bordering on the genius some of the interactions were incredible, and that was just the subtitled version, in Korean I am sure it would have been mind-blowing.

3. It's the kind of film you will never forget, it is so truly unique I am fearing a Hollywood remake.

4. Cinematography was often breathtaking.

5. Acting was so good I'd call it perfect.","May 18, 2020"
10,"Without spoiling it, Parasite is the amazing film equivalent to ""Is it wrong to steel bread to feed a starving family?""","If there's an argument that's been a part of society since the dawn of time is that of class. From the days of cavemen, the Roman Empire, the Enlightment, and even modern times, philosophers, scholars and storytellers have explored the ideology of the wealthy and poor. It's something that people have wanted to fix to create more equality and people that discuss whether things should be equal at all. It's hard to give my opinion because we have so many viewpoints that's its challenging to paint who exactly is in the wrong. There are good wealthy people and bad poor people and vice versa. This is also something that many movies has dived into.

In fact, one of my favorite movies of the 2000's is the science-fiction thriller, Snowpiercer. It was a creative way to look at corrupted societies and how it unfavorably placed the poor without a way out. It's a movie with a lot of layers and Korean director Boon Joon-Ho knew it was important to make it just as entertaining as it was to explore and read into. It looks like he's made another movie about class, except Parasite is a smaller story about two families, but is still as impactful.

We start with a family of four living in the slums, in a basement under a store; father Kim Ki-Taek (played by Song Kang-ho), mother Chung-sook (played by Jang Hye-jin), son Kim Ki-woo (played by Choi Woo-shik) and daughter Kim Ki-Jeong (played by Park So-dam). They struggle for work enough that they take jobs constructing pizza boxes. When a friend of the son comes to visit, he offers Kim Ki-woo an English tutoring job to a wealthy family's daughter. He accepts and sees a world he only dreamt of; a fancy house built by a famous architect, wide space, a backyard and nice cars.

After some convincing from the family, a scheme is made so that the daughter is hired as an art therapist for the youngest son, the father as a new driver/errand runner, and the mother as the new housekeeper. The family is overjoyed that their con has fooled the other family. This leads into them celebrating when the other family leaves for a camping trip by eating and drinking in the living room. Things go wrong when the previous housekeeper returns to get something.

Though there is a second half to the movie, I can't talk about it without spoiling it. Parasite is one of those movies that spans a lot of genres, and yet keeps it focused enough to make it one of the best movies of 2019. It may sound like a typical dark comedy, but because the character development focuses on all four members of the family, it allowed the story to go in a variety of directions that I didn't expect. At the front, this is still a story on class difference. A lot of these movies will revolve around the theme of ""helping the poor"". Thankfully, Parasite is a smarter movie and tries something different.

Parasite doesn't try to make the wealthy family out to be villains. But they don't try to paint the main family in a complete positive light either. These are all grey characters that are simply living life and the lengths their going to climb up. This could mean conning themselves into good jobs or getting a party together for a child. If anything, it tries to lean into how stabbing others in the back to get what they want is bad, but even that can depend on a number of factors. This movie is the prime example of ""would you steal a loaf of bread to feed a starving family"".

Not only is the movie written and directed beautifully, but it's acted amazingly. Though the movie is in Korean, you can tell the actors are still giving it their all as they each understand the complexities of their situation and why each one would make the decisions they make. This also remains one of the better ensemble pieces I've seen this year, hence why I'm not naming them one by one. I noticed this as well in Snowpiercer with how Bong Joon-ho knows how to cast as a whole and work with what he has.

I'll give this ten fancy houses out of ten. It may be in a different language, but this is already one of my favorite movies of the year. This is the kind of movie that can be hard to describe, but my best bet is to simply tell others to see it. I feel like that even talking about it a little could ruin it. Check it out and see just how complicated class difference really is.","Nov 14, 2019"
10,Masterfully Crafted,"A well crafted film that does not confine itself to a genre. Equal parts thriller, drama, comedy, and suspense. While it is a scathing indictment on classism, it does an amazing job of condemning the institution and not necessarily the individual. It is in identifying with characters that Joon-ho really exposes the psychological hold economic class has on the individual and society. The pacing is brilliant, always engaging and playing with tempo nicely. Loved it.","Apr 13, 2020"
10,Phenomenal,"It really does live up to the hype, truly a great film.","Mar 6, 2021"
10,Amazing,Amazing. Though it's not a film you feel the need to see again as you probably would for other tens.,"Jan 31, 2021"
10,One of the best films of this decade,"I am remarkably stingy with my 10/10 ratings. I'll be the first person to acknowledge this. Of the roughly 2600 titles I've rated on here, only 34 have a 10. Parasite is one of them. If this isn't a masterpiece, then I don't know what is.

I'm going to keep it vague on the plot-front, because I didn't know anything about it going in, and was really excited to see it progress and unfold in satisfying, unexpected ways.

What I will say is that this film, more than just about any other I've seen, put me through so many different emotional states during its 132-minute runtime, and did so without ever feeling muddled or tonally inconsistent. Parts of this movie were hilarious. Parts were heartbreaking. Other parts were insanely suspenseful (I'm honestly not sure if I've felt this close to the edge of my seat since the final season of Breaking Bad, way back in 2013).

And it does all this while being perfectly paced, beautifully directed, and amazingly acted from every single member of its cast. All the characters are understandable and sympathetic to some degree; the amount of conflict, drama and tension derived from a narrative with no clear heroes and villains is staggering. You come to care for just about all of them.

I'm stumped to come up with any flaws for this movie. And sure, I've seen many movies that are hard to fault, but it's rare that a movie appeals to me on a gut level and excites me to this degree while also being so close to technically perfect. It's extremely entertaining, thoroughly moving in so many different ways, and as icing on the cake there's a ton of social commentary and some heavy themes to chew on once the movie's over (and this one's not going to leave my head for a while, I can tell).

Catch this one when you can and believe the hype. Joon-Ho Bong has made many great films (and so far no bad one's), but this even manages to stand head and shoulders above all the others.

When it comes time to consider what the best film of the 2010s was, this one will surely be up there.","Jul 5, 2019"
10,A marvellous film (albeit 20% of reviewers don't 'get it').,"Not everyone will understand the subtle ironies and dark humour written into the script. This is a slowly evolving, funny and engaging film for those who have the ability to let the magic unfold without any expectations or needing an explanation for everything. Storyline and characterization are all that's needed for any film to work at a basic level and there is so much originality and depth here to keep the viewer engaged throughout the duration. Many, many contemporary films follow established formulae whereas this one stands alone. For anyone after repetitive, safe, bland, boring and brain-numbing, CGI-laced 'entertainment' I'd recommend trying something other than this work of admirable quality which is well-filmed and acted throughout.","Feb 2, 2022"
10,Totally immersed the whole way.,"This movie is not a horror movie not a suspense movie but I was just on the edge of my seat the whole way through. The tense string of relationships that hold all of the characters together... More thrilling than a thriller, more suspenseful than a suspense movie, More guessing than a murder mystery. It takes the typical human reaction to the next level. Just watch it without any prejudice. It will send your emotions on a journey that does not allow you to cheer for one character or the other. Entertaining as well as stab you in the stomach deeply with a moral sword to see how you feel. A masterpiece with your morals as well as your feelings for justice.","Oct 23, 2019"
10,Astonishing Piece of Masterful Film Work,"This is where the class dystopia begins, we see a story that looks as if it is false or to good to be true but it is!

10,It's so metaphorical!,"'Parasite - an organism that lives in or on an organism of another species (its host) and benefits by deriving nutrients at the other's expense.'

When working-class Woo-sik Choi gets a job tutoring Sao-dam, the daughter of the rich Park family, so begins the slow, progressive attachment of the parasite to its host. This is a domestic comedy/drama with universal undertones of class division that takes a dark turn in a climax that will leave you reeling. There are layers to the story which, without revealing the intricacies of plot, play on class tensions, identity and entrapment.

A genre-bending tour de force from South Korea, deftly told by writer-director Bong Joon-Ho and brilliantly inhabited by an award-winning ensemble cast. In a meritocracy who is the parasite and who is the host? A cinematic ode to scratching below the surface of an all too perfect picture only to release a scurry of hidden roaches.","Feb 3, 2020"
10,Indeed a good film!,"I was reluctant to watch this. I could see from the trailer that it has good production value, yet I was worried it would be too weird, being a Korean/an Asian language thriller. Eventually I did watch it and I am glad! I'm also glad it won all those Oscars.

The blend of dark comedy in this social thriller definitely attributed to an enjoyable and entertaining experience and made me more engaged with the story. It is very well made and it deals with various interesting subjects/issues of our society, all in the premise of a collision of social classes (extreme poverty with extreme wealth).","Feb 24, 2020"
10,One of the ones the Oscars got right,"What an incredible film. I'm not even going to talk much about it in detail because I just want to encourage others to watch it. It shouldn't be detailed, just watched. It was perfect from top to bottom. It gets everything it wants to accomplish right, and does it in such an in your face yet subtle way. The class struggle, the strong bond of family, happiness, love, teenage angst, motherhood, pain, loss, just all of it. One of the best films of this generation, and I don't think I give away that kind of praise easily.","Feb 12, 2021"

10,One of the best films I've seen in years!,"This movie is about so much more than class differences. It's survival,what you would do for your family. Preconceived ideas of peoples worth and actions. I was so nervous as the film came to a close. It was very intriguing! Wonderful!","Feb 4, 2020"
10,The best movie in the WORLD,The movie is truly a masterpiece...! I don't understand how this movie with such local sentiments can deliver something that is so universal...!The best cinematic experience I had this year. Everything is perfect.,"Feb 7, 2020"
10,Best Movie of 2019 by Far,"Nothing comes close. In terms of direction, writing and performances.","Jan 20, 2020"
10,The film of the year,"The less you know about this movie heading in, the better. Parasite is a wonderfully original film from South Korea that manages to mix several genres together perfectly. This tale about class is filled with poignant metaphors and social commentary. Bong Joon Ho's vision and mesmerizing control over his craft make for an unforgettable experience.

This isn't a simple rich vs poor story where there are clear protagonists or antagonists, and therein lies the beauty of Parasite. It's just murky enough to provide some true thought-provoking imagery and storytelling. Don't let the one inch barrier of subtitles prevent you from seeing this modern masterpiece.","Feb 6, 2020"
10,That's entertainment.,"Jumping on the post-Oscar win bandwagon, I went to see this film today. Having heard the near unanimous praise from peers and other reviews, I had high expectations for this film. It was also the first Korean film I watched. The movie starts, and I'm literally glued to my seat-it was very entertaining. The camera movement, the way the characters speaks, the overall pacing, the black comedy tone-everything was just so freshly packaged, I wanted a refill the moment the movie was over. A predominant theme of this movie is the class structure-from a non-Korean's point of view it was quite clear and somewhat tragic to see. If I had one problem with this film, I think some of the class struggle content was probably too overt (especially in the dialogue) and could have been handled more subtly. Despite that, it is definitely a film that deserved all the accolades it received. It is first movie that I watched in theaters where I instantly wanted to rewatch it. Now that folks, is entertainment.","Feb 13, 2020"
10,THIS. IS. SO. METAPHORICAL.,"'Parasite', this year's winner of the Cannes Film Festival's highest award, the Palme d'Or, is so many things - tiptoeing different genres, exploring themes of family, work, inequality, and the class divide - rolled into one thoroughly wild, exciting, hilarious, dark, tragic, and unpredictable film.

Honestly, I can only sum it up in the wise words spoken by one of the characters: THIS. IS. SO. METAPHORICAL.","Sep 28, 2019"
10,Best movie of 2019 hands down.,"I will keep it short go see this film everyone. Totally deserves all its awards a masterpiece in film making by the director who gave us memories of murder. If you are a fan of Korean movies you will clearly love it and if you arent this may change your perception. It has it all comedy, drama, thriller you name it all merge beautifully.

ENOUGH SAID GO SEE IT NOW.","Apr 4, 2020"
10,Captivating Movie,"One of the best movies I have seen so far. It is intuitive, funny and keep you watching with fascination. The best is that you can't predict the course of the movie and it continues to surprise throughout. I can highly recommend anyone to watch this movie.","May 20, 2020"
10,"awe-inspiring, magnificent work of art","Much has been said and written about this monumental piece of art and unless you've been living under a rock, you've already seen it or at least have heard a good deal about it so I won't go about the plot details or discuss its facets and themes. I just want to point out that, in my opinion, director Bong Joon Ho does two things that separates and elevates this work from almost every other message-oriented/social commentary films.

First, in order to convey his message, instead of for example, putting a guy in front of a microphone to look straight in the audiences' eyes and say that ""capitalism is bad"" or ""these rifts in society are killing our souls"" and alike, instead of doing that, he goes out of his way to masterfully create a story, a setting that will demonstrate the problems of a western capitalism module. He does indeed show us, not blandly tell us, that in a parasitic society, almost everyone can identify as a parasite, nonwithstanding their virtues and morales. It is left to audiences themselves to decide whether this story is believable or not, or rather whether this kind of story is something real or something manipulative.

Secondly, I simply adored how perfect of a genre blend this film was. It easily classifies itself as a dark comedy, an edge-of-a-seat thriller, a drama, there are a few overt political elements mixed into it and we can even indulge in some delicious violent scenes, characteristic of south-eastern asian cinema. All in all, only a master of a craft, a seasoned veteran of this medium can take on such arduous task, such hazardous venture and come out triumphant.","Apr 19, 2022"
10,132 minutes of perfectly measured film,"Like a five star dish, every minute of this film is superb, respecting the time it asks of you, the viewer, as it takes you through a roller coaster of highs and lows. It is not overly dramatic nor does deplete you emotionally, which is my typical fear with Korean dramas and thrillers. I must reiterate that you will not leave this movie with a sense of innocence lost, like your first reading of The Lord of the Flies or your first watching of Oldboy. The comedy cuts through the perfectly balanced two hours and change experience that Bong Jong Ho has prepared for you.

Avoid spoilers at all costs and dive in at the marvel of the story it can tell within two hours, as Hollywood struggles with two part films and making coherence out of overly packed blockbusters like Star Wars.

Perhaps a permanent entry into the Top 250 films of all time.","Jan 9, 2020"
10,Very very as in VERY good!,"It's actually perfect for an international scene, because the theme is relevant in every society but also because it plays with the western world view of how we all think Korea is regarding everything American= cool. Yet at the same time it's making fun of all people in the West at the same time. It is like a giant f... finger in our face, this is how a movie should be composed, so go back to your banal, predictable styles and continue as you were. You have not seen this one coming. It's clever and cute in its persona gallery. We are sitting there waiting for someone to hate but somehow come to like all the characters. 5 min into the movie you have forgotten that it's a Korean cast and the language is unknown to you. Something that impressed me. The sad ending is somehow terrible because it's real. This is life and it's Hollywood to think it would be any different. I truly love the originality and full circle of the script, it's like if you write a master thesis that just hits home where you were able to tie all knots elegantly and with great content. I loved this movie. And I actually can't remember if I ever saw something this original and mind blowing which was not sci-fi.","Mar 8, 2020"

10,This movie is going up in the top 250 chart,"Usually it has been observed that the movies start with high ratings because fans give the highest possible ratings initially but when more people watch them the ratings decline, but this one going up in the chart.

This says a lot about this one.

Another Korean master piece after Oldboy. Don't miss it, thanks me later.","Dec 1, 2019"
10,One of the best foreign films I've ever seen,I have to admit originally I wasn't much interested in watching this film in cinema cause at the time I was to lazy to read subtitles but my friend really wanted to watch this film and kept on insisting for me to go along so I just went and watched it in cinema and i did praise my friend alot for his choice what a great entertaining movie this was it kept me gripped through from beginning to end. At the time it was the best Korean film I had seen at the time and it is what got me to watch more korean movies and tv shows. I've seen this movie 3 more times sins in total 3 times in colour and 1 time in black and white. All the ratings and praises are there for the films but I would still encourage people who haven't seen parasite to definitely give it a try you will not be disappointed at any point. It is really fast moving and the performances are spot on all cast and crew have done a fabulous job. this is definitely 10/10 for me.,"Dec 26, 2020"
10,A Masterpiece in Filmmaking,"Director Bong Joon Ho has been on my radar for years now, as I believe him to be one of the best storytellers out there right now. Admittedly, I haven't seen the majority of his films but his two most recent works in Snowpiecer and Okja were among the best films of their consecutive years. I thought both of those films were great, so I was very eagerly awaiting his newest film, Parasite. After viewing, not only does this film deserve to be talked about as one of the best films to be released in 2019, but I personally think this may just be the very best movie you'll see all year. Now, some people may not like the turn it takes, but here's why I think Parasite demands to be seen.

To go into detail about this premise would be to ruin it for those who haven't seen it, so I'll stick to the basics here. The Kim family lives in a basement living space. All unemployed, they find any way they can to make things work. Ki-woo, the eldest sibling in the family, is given the opportunity to tutor the daughter of the rich Park family. Getting smarter and smarter as the first act really kicks into gear, the Kim family becomes a group of very clever con-artists. Meaning well and doing everything they can to keep things legitimate, this makes for some terrific tension.

The biggest praise I can give this film is that it's constantly in motion, never wasting a moment to surprise you. The set-up for this movie has many clever aspects to it, the second act throws you a real curveball and the finale doesn't disappoint either. Some viewers may think this movie goes off the rails toward the end, but I found it to be an overall brilliant piece of storytelling. Each time you think the movie has said everything it wants to, it becomes that much more interesting. In other hands, this story could've have come off as a very generic film, but there's truly something special about how well-made Parasite is.

Wonderfully shot by cinematographer Kyung-pyo Hong, each frame of this movie has more than one thing to say. It's very rare these days that shot compositions are done in such a way that they seem to tell a story as well, but even in the moments when the focus is on the characters alone, there are things happening in the background or even signs in the framing that things are coming soon. This movie is brilliantly made in every way.

It's very rare when I review a film and struggle to at least come up with one negative here, so I won't bother trying, because I loved this movie too much to let anything take away from it. I will just say that certain aspects may not work for everyone. Parasite is a perfect example of why I love movies so much. A great, engaging story that surprises you from start to finish, along with one of the best crews to work on a film yet this year. I can't praise this film enough. This Korean language film has broken through and I wouldn't be surprised in the slightest if it takes home the award for best foreign film and even a nomination for best picture. This is as close to a masterpiece you can get today.","Oct 28, 2019"
10,World cinema at its best.,Its nothing short of a masterpiece. The acting and writing is just excellent. There is never a dull moment in the movie. It is one of those movies where you never have to look at the watch to see how much time has passed by. The class struggle is brought out in a humorous way that is dark and disturbing at the same time. The characters seem very real and remain fresh in memory long after the movie is over. A must watch Korean film.,"May 2, 2020"
10,Couldn't be a better movie,"The plot is awesome. Bang jon hoo know how to portait. The background team worked hard to deliver this simple but awesome thriller that changed every cinematic experience I have ever seen. Actors are perfect. Everyone must see, can be seen with family.","Feb 10, 2020"
10,Food for thought delivered with exciting wit,"Parasite is the best movie of the year. This Korean movie won the renowned Palme d'Or of the 2019 Cannes Film Festival. It has been selected as the South Korean entry for Best International Feature Film at the ninety-second Academy Awards.

This movie combines multiple genres such as comedy, drama, horror, thriller and tragedy. The main theme is the clash between rich and poor in the Republic of Korea. This conflict has been the main topic in other great films such as The Housemaid and The Taste of Money. Parasite however is less cumbersome, melodramatic and moralizing and convinces with wit, depth and creativity instead.

International audiences might feel slightly confused by this unusual genre mixture at first contact but this is exactly what makes this movie so unique. The story starts in a dramatic way and portrays a poor family who lives in a small semi-basement apartment and struggles to make ends meet. The movie gets more comedic when the son of said family gets the unexpected opportunity to replace a friend as English tutor for the beautiful daughter of a wealthy family. The film turns into a thriller when the four family members gradually infiltrate and even replace the personnel of the wealthy family with ethically questionable procedures. The movie turns into a horror film when the family realizes that the family mansion hides a creepy secret as things gradually spin out of control. The film ends as an almost surreal tragedy that will leave the audience speechless. Parasite is a movie the leaves a lasting impression, offers much food for thought and should animate philosophical discussions. The movie is so detailed, precise and profound that it deserves to be purchased to be watched time and again.

I'm grateful that I had the opportunity to watch this movie in French in a Canadian cinema and so were the numerous other members of the audience in the packed movie theatre. People are craving for a change and are tired of tame, predictable and repetitive Hollywood superhero prequels, remakes and sequels. There should be more creative, dynamic and entertaining international movies like Parasite in movie theatres all around the world. If you desire to make a statement in favour of cinema as an artistic expression rather than shallow entertainment, do yourself a favour and enjoy this incredible movie on the big screen. This movie has the potential to become a cult classic and deserves all the praise it gets.","Nov 12, 2019"
10,Unforgettable and original,"Stunning. This is a movie of superlatives. Every aspect of this movie is well done from the original story to the acting and directing. It is a drama, comedy, unbiased social commentary, thriller - a lot in one.

The completely accessible and involving story is well written and constructed - every scene has a purpose. Given the extremes that this story goes to - it's still plausible - the thriller elements don't get out of hand or descend into stupidity. There is a social commentary on class and wealth that is so effectively laid out from start to finish. It has changed the way I think about relationships across the wealth divide.

Don't read anything about the story before you watch it. Just go and see it.

This Korean cast and director have made an unforgettable film that will be talked about for years to come. And it deserves every accolade out there.","Dec 18, 2019"
10,This is EVERYTHING !,Think of all movie genres you can think of and you will find a piece of everything in this movie. This is unpredictable... this will intense. This will make you keep guessing and then you will be like wtf cuz none of your guesses would be right. This is everything.,"Feb 16, 2020"
10,This is what I call a proper korean movie,"After watching the most overrated korean movie ever ""the burning"", I almost lost the trust on imdb reviews but this movie put my trust back. It has everything, comedy , thrilling elements, suspense, emotional moments, satire and each and every actor played their role perfectly. It was treat to watch this movie. Highly recommended, just go for it.","Oct 4, 2019"
10,This film is engaging,"I have seen this film 2 times, and in the middle of the third. I was introduced to this film via an Alternative Cinema class for my University, otherwise I would probably have never seen this film. As the title states, this film is captivating from the very first scenes.

I rather enjoy being drawn into a story by quick witted individuals and the family in Parasite are no exception. I will not go into the story as more professional writers than me have already done so. However, I will go into what I (a cinema fan) thought.

The film is primarily driven by the plot. There is no need for violence (at least for a majority of the film) to keep you engaged. Each chapter in the film perfectly leads to the climax, allwhile being fed foreshadowing details that are revealed in the final act. Korean cinema is juxtaposed by American cinema, and we have to appreciate what they do differently, and better.

If you want to have a good laugh, just sort this film's reviews by lowest rating first XD.","Dec 4, 2023"
10,"I Love You, Mr. Bong! (heart)","As a long-time fan of Bong and Song, I always knew this pair would make it at Cannes someday, and finally!!!! ^_^ (~Naneon Bong-iiyah~) I purposely never watched a single trailer of this in order to fully enjoy it and I'm glad it turned out Bong had made up for Ok-ja very successfully. Also, I'd like to add that Moongwang, the former housekeeper was ridiculously good. Despite all the laughs throughout the movie, it's quite bitter and sad and gets you thinking of the modern hierarchical, absurd society where we live in, all the way back home. I hope Bong's next movie would be just as good as Parasite.","May 30, 2019"
10,Hollywood only WISHES it produced films this good.,"After watching this, I could not stop thinking about it for several days. After the second watch, I noticed several other easter eggs, hidden gems that neatly tied all of the themes together.

THIS is how movies should be made. I had expected 1917 to win all the awards, but after seeing this, I knew this was the movie that should sweep this years Oscars.

And finally, the Oscars got it right in choosing a foreign-language film as Best Picture winner. And it's not hard to see why. Despite it being set in South Korea, it incorporates universal themes such as poverty, trying whatever it takes to get your family a better life and class differences.

Rightfully, they'll be talking about this film for decades.","Feb 22, 2020"
10,Masterpiece.,"Gisaengchung is an amazing film with a wonderful and strong script, amazing acting, beautiful cinematography and a great production design. The film is a comedy, a thriller and a strong drama. Parasites in two worlds, poor ones and rich ones. Rich being parasites to poor people, exploiting them and poor people getting better things from the rich using some tricks. This movie is mainly about poor people being parasites, with a strong direction. A wonderful film, a masterpiece!","Feb 13, 2020"
10,Tension between upperclass elegance and underground threat has never been more in your face.,"After winning the Palme d'Or in Cannes, the French Oscars let's say, Sydney Film Festival was quick to reel in that line and get Parasite to screen at multiple sold out venues around the city. At the end of the festival, the film got awarded the biggest price (Best Film) and distributor Madman Entertainment decided to ride that wave of interest in the film, releasing this Korean dark comedic masterpiece just a week later in Australian cinemas.

Ki-woo (Choi Woo-sick) is a young man with not much to look forward to. He basically lives in a basement apartment with his scruffy dad Ki-taek (Song Kang-ho), snappy mother Chung-sook (Hyae Jin Chang) and his clever sister Ki-jung (Park So-dam). Their tiny confined home feels too small to live in with four adults. They use free wi-fi from their neighbours and try to make some easy money by folding boxes for a pizza delivery company, until Ki-woo's friend offers him to take over a student to tutor.

Faking a university diploma and a shameless backstory, Ki-woo introduces himself to a rich family in a dream house with the most well maintained lawn you've ever seen. Here he becomes the tutor to Da-hye (Ziso Jung), daughter of wealthy CEO Mr. Park (Lee Sun-kyun) and his emotionally unstable wife Yeon-kyo (Jo Yeo-jeong). Everything seems to go just as planned, until the almost perfectly executed plan starts to unravel more and more out of control.

Scriptwriters Bong Joon-ho (who also directed) and Han Jin-won have so many twists up their sleeves to make this the most entertaining and well-written film you'll see this year. Every line gets delivered so smoothly, as if it seems like these characters are real people who are living through this story, with Jung Jae-il's classical score, masterfully playing in the background. The cinematography by Hong Kyung-pyo differentiates itself from a more realistic gritty style in the basement apartment, to a more dreamlike perfectly slick style when focusing on our wealthy characters. This point of view makes us look at these two very contrasting groups of people in a different way, to make it even clearer that they don't belong in the same world. Class systems have never looked more down to earth yet perfect before.

Though Bong wants you to feel for both parties, the lines will blur at certain points and make your sympathy for anyone bounce back and forth with feverish consequences. Everyone has a sense of selfishness to them when it comes to goals, but being nice doesn't take that much effort. The film focuses on poverty, desperation and what we are willing to do to take what should be ours. Tension between upperclass elegance and underground threat has never been more in your face. Bong (Okja) always loves to blur the lines of genre and he makes sure he hits every step on the staircase, to succeed in his efforts.

Parasite is a mite that doesn't discriminate and will get under every moviegoer's skin, no matter what background you come from. The power of this story, is found in the way comedy and drama rub each other in just the right way to spark a bit of thriller, that flips over into pure horror when despair and hate meet each other. This is one infestation you can't get rid off.","Jun 30, 2019"
10,Plato Would have Loved,"I spent some time with the movie ""Parasite"" tonight. It captured me in it's symbiotic web. I'm sure there is not a single adjective that could describe it adequately...so I won't attempt that magficent accomplishment. Parasite tugged on every ounce of my acquired knowledge in philosophy, literature and Korean (yes...I do have a very tiny bit of that :) ) The set design was amazing...and it may give 1917 a run for it's money.

The stairs...oh so thoroughly magnificent in the simplicity yet the most complex of ""metaphors"" (yeah, I made myself giggle on that one.) I was instantly reminiscent of my Philosophy 101 ""Allegory of the Cave""....""I went down."" Thank you Herr Hanak.

Okay, I've lost all of you, I loved this movie for the Best Foreign Film...mostly because my theater neighbors tonight ate every kind of snack bar food possible...I will have nightmares about the gnawing, they chatted and checked their phones throughout...then they pottied and were able to read the screen....and then they seemed confused. Wonder why.

My feeling about awards..knowing the methodolgy of the voting....this film will not be best picture on Oscar night.","Jan 22, 2020"
10,Just saw it for the second time.,"PARASITE impressed me enough that I wanted to see it again. Having done so, I've increased my initial 9 rating to a full 10.

What I thought were plot holes turned out to have simple explanations that I had missed in my initial viewing. And with the element of surprise gone, I could more fully concentrate on the characters and their motives. I especially liked that no one here is 100% blameless or 100% evil. That kind of moral ambiguity is common in everyday life. I only wish it were more common in movies.

This time, I also paid much closer attention to the film's abundant symbolism. Admittedly, though, I still couldn't figure out the significance of the Scholar's Rock. But that says more about me than it does about this magnificently brilliant film.

If not the for THE IRISHMAN, I would root for PARASITE as this year's Best Picture winner. Still, it's a shoo-in for Best Foreign Language Film.","Feb 3, 2020"
10,Excellent!,"Great work! from start to end, it is wickedly funny and darkly disturbing all at the same time. The narrative and the actors were excellent. One of the better endings of a movie, The most original film and one of the 10 best films of 2019.","Jan 13, 2020"
10,One of the decade's most clever and original,"South Korean film crews may be World Cinema's most painstakingly dedicated; the movies are detailed and creatively daring in ways that would be impermissible under Hollywood supervision, on top of letting the actors give their all and show their most unflattering selves. As is the case with Bong Joon-ho's Parasite, they might also produce some of our time's most impressively original stories and supply timely commentary in the process.

We meet the impoverished Kim family, father Ki-taek (Song Kang-ho), mother Chung-sook (Jang Hye-jin), son Ki-woo (Choi Woo-shik), and daughter Ki-jeong (Park So-dam), and we soon learn they aren't the most honest bunch. Ki-woo, through his friend Min-hyuk, gets hired as a homeschool English teacher, using forged Oxford documents, at the home of the upper-class Park family; tech company CEO Dong-ik (Lee Sun-kyun), his stressed-out wife Yeon-gyo (a wonderful Cho Yeo-jeong), teen daughter Da-hye (Jung Ji-so), and little Da-song (Jung Hyun-joon). This is but the beginning of the Kim family's sneaky ascent.

Learning of Da-song's troubles, Ki-woo, going by ""Kevin"", informs Mrs. Park of an art therapist he knows named ""Veronica"", who is actually Ki-jeong, who may help Da-song evolve. Through a series of events I won't spoil, ""Veronica"" later gets the chance to recommend a new chauffeur for the Park family in the form of Ki-taek, going by ""Mr. Kim"", who in turn recommends a new housekeeper, played by Chung-sook.

The way the Kims continually fool the Parks - from meticulous script recitations in their basement flat to ad-libbing based on research they've done for the fields they pretend to work in - is clever, tense, impossible to predict, and morbidly hilarious throughout. It is made even more amusing to behold thanks to how it's edited (for instance: cutting from Ki-taek lying to Yeon-gyo, to him finishing the same sentence during Ki-woo's rehearsals), how purposefully the staging and cinematography are done (the vast Park household juxtaposed against the cramped Kim residence), and how utterly believable these performances are.

The actors who portray the Kims, in particular, give remarkably layered performances. Each actor is required to play the character in their natural environment, plus the roles they themselves assume when posing as the Park family's home employees.

The characters themselves are convincing actors, hence their successful duping of the Parks, which makes each real-world actor's performance all the more considerable. And yes, it seems a bit unlikely that the Parks would fall for the scam and refrain from asking questions when each new employee of theirs happens to know someone suited for a very recently vacated position, but the film is self-aware and deliberate about this, not only because the Parks - in their carefree luxury - aren't the most observant.

This is all comical to experience, yes, but what Bong has to say about class inequity and - during the film's bleaker, later scenes - how it isn't necessarily so simple as letting the poor ""have some luxury"" for the sake of fairness, is what makes Parasite stick. We may understand the downtrodden Kims (we learn from a revelation that their desperation is not unique), and laugh at their conniving schemes, but are they truly Sherwoodian heroes in the end?

Parasite is generally well-loved, but divisive in the circles you'd expect. My guilty-pleasure film critic Armond White is certain that the film scoffs at nuclear families (also calling it a ""cancel-culture comedy"" because, I guess, anti-family sentiments are common amongst those who also like to ""cancel"" offensive celebrities and, indeed, berate classism). So far as I can decipher, White's main evidence is the fact that, in the story, a traditional and successful family suffers comically at the hands of the semi-titular social parasites - whom he likens to entitled modern Communists and AntiFa terrorists.

As mentioned, the Kims aren't strictly heroes or justified. Isn't this a bit like saying Midsommar seeks to paint Swedish tradition as perverse because it has characters (read: villains) who co-opt our customs perversely? But then, psh, who'd reason like that?","Dec 6, 2019"
10,It really is as great as everyone is says.,"A haunting parable, with so many stark images that will forever be burned into my brain. A pointed highlight of the differences between the haves and have-nots. A sublimely original movie that's full of surprises and unnerving but hilarious anxiety.","Feb 7, 2020"
10,an excellent movie,"With small doses of suspense, a great film. An original and entertaining mix of several genres. It shows a story where the parallels of two different social classes are noted, with a small dose of suspense, with a subtle style and excellent photography. A plot where the harsh reality is told that shows us the terrible poverty in which nobody wants, being an emotional struggle the main plot of two different social classes, one where it shows us that wealth makes people selfish and poverty more vulnerable. In the end we realize that we are all parasites at some point. Fully recommended, with an absorbing and visually powerful narrative.","Dec 1, 2024"
10,Thy shall not ridicule fellas with body odor. Definitely deserves the best picture award.,"Finally saw this much talked about film. As a fan of Korean thrillers, this film surpassed my expectations. The film is about a poor family who cleverly n cunningly become employed by a wealthy couple, posing as unrelated, highly qualified individuals.

The film begins like a dark satire, it then proceeds into a captivating thriller n ends like a surreal crime.

The film is very entertaining inspite of the sad stuff shown about poor fellas but mind u, it is not at all demeaning. It is very gripping n weirdly hilarious.","Feb 4, 2020"

10,A Sharp Social Satire Wrapped in Thrilling Suspense and Dark Comedy,"*Parasite* (*Gisaengchung*, 2019), directed by Bong Joon-ho, is a masterful, genre-bending film that explores themes of class disparity, greed, and survival. The film follows the impoverished Kim family as they scheme their way into the lives of the wealthy Park family, with each member posing as a highly qualified professional. What begins as a darkly comedic take on social mobility soon escalates into a tense, unpredictable thriller.

Bong Joon-ho's direction is brilliant, seamlessly blending social commentary with gripping suspense, dark humor, and shocking twists. The film's tone shifts effortlessly between comedy, drama, and horror, keeping the audience engaged and on edge. The intricate, layered screenplay, co-written by Bong, delves into the growing divide between the rich and the poor, examining the absurdities and brutal realities of class conflict in modern society.

The performances are outstanding, with each member of the Kim and Park families playing their roles to perfection. Song Kang-ho, a frequent collaborator with Bong, delivers a standout performance as Kim Ki-taek, the patriarch of the Kim family. His portrayal of a man both desperate and cunning, trapped in a cycle of poverty, is poignant and powerful.

The cinematography by Hong Kyung-pyo is another highlight, with the stark contrast between the cramped, dingy basement where the Kim family lives and the sleek, modern luxury of the Park family's home visually reinforcing the class divide. The design of the Park house, with its large windows and clean lines, plays a crucial role in building suspense and tension as the story unfolds.

*Parasite* is full of symbolism and metaphors, from the ""staircases"" that represent social hierarchy to the basement that becomes a literal underworld of hidden secrets. The film's title itself reflects the parasitic relationship between the families, as each feeds off the other in different ways, but also comments on the broader systemic inequalities in society.

The film's climactic twist and its devastating final act are shocking and leave a lasting impression. Bong Joon-ho skillfully combines moments of brutal violence with emotional depth, creating a conclusion that is as tragic as it is thought-provoking.

Overall, *Parasite* is a near-perfect film that transcends genre and cultural barriers. It is a searing critique of inequality, told with biting wit, suspense, and a remarkable attention to detail. Its historic win at the 2020 Oscars, where it became the first non-English language film to win Best Picture, solidified its place as one of the most important and influential films of the decade.","Sep 27, 2024"
10,"Engaging, well written and totally captivating","In an age of superhero movies (which I love) comes a story that is so captivating and engaging from early on that I hope it wins an Oscar. Unlike other years where the ""Oscar buzzy"" movies are really drawn out or not that great, this movie is something that everyone can understand and the story flow, twists and turns and commentary on society all are so well done. My wife and I loved this movie. This is definitely a classic.","Oct 12, 2019"
10,Well-earned sweep of the 2020 Oscars,"""You know what kind of plan never fails? No plan. No plan at all. You know why? Because life cannot be planned."" - Ki-Taek

Parasite is fantastic.

It's clever. It's funny. It's disturbing. And yes, there is a powerful underlying theme of the divide between rich and poor. But the latter is so deftly weaved into the fabric of the story, you really don't think about it much until a fateful scene before the last act.

It fully deserved the Oscar for Best Picture and Director. If only for the peach fuzz fight scene.","Nov 27, 2020"
10,One of my favourites,"The film ""Parasite"", helmed by Bong Joon Ho, transcends above mere cinematic entertainment, offering a riveting cinematic experience. This film is a masterwork that deftly combines aspects of black comedy, drama, and thriller to create a compelling and lasting narrative.

Fundamentally, the narrative presents a perceptive and provocative analysis of socioeconomic and class disparities. The impoverished Kim family skillfully and frequently playfully spies on the rich Park family. What starts out as a humorous joke quickly turns into a gripping and unexpected adventure that keeps viewers on edge the entire time.

Bong Joon Ho demonstrates his skillful handling of balancing many genres and tones.

The movie moves along at a terrific clip, with careful, nuanced touches that enhance the plot in every scene. With expertly planned color schemes and exquisitely placed views, the film's visual design and camerawork are superb and contribute to its emotional impact.

Plus, the acting is superb. The father of the Kim family, played by Song Kang-ho, gives a complex and moving performance that perfectly captures the main ideas of the movie. Each character feels real and alive thanks to the powerful and unforgettable performances given by every member of the Kim and Park families.

The soundtrack to ""Parasite"" is just as iconic as the film's aesthetic. The subdued, occasionally tense soundtrack draws the viewer even deeper into the film's universe by enhancing the mood and feeling of each scene.

A film like ""Parasite"" sticks with you long after you've watched it. It is a thought-provoking and engaging movie experience because to its complex plot, outstanding dramatic performances, and great directing by Bong Joon Ho.

To sum up, ""Parasite"" is a contemporary masterpiece that exemplifies the ability of film to delve into intricate social themes with a gripping and intense narrative. All movie buffs should see it, and it will surely go down in history as one of the best movies ever made.","Aug 2, 2024"
10,The best,"This movie is a masterpiece. It is well casted and acted, the cinematography was very well done. The themes are thought provoking. But the greatest thing about this movie is how much love, effort and dedication went into this. This movie has every genre in it, yet it doesn't feel too cramped. It might be unrealistic and some parts but the story was so amazing. The little details in this movie is what makes it a modern day masterpiece.

Parasite is one of those movies that you will never forget and rewatch it over and over again. It is such a fine experience watching this movie, and everything is perfect about it. 10/10.","Jul 31, 2024"
10,This is a memorable movie,"On one side is a flooded shabby room, on the other side is a birthday party. On one side is a cold and hard gymnasium, on the other side is a luxurious and soft back garden. Money is an iron that irons everything flat. They use the free Internet, live in the basement, and do whatever it takes to get a job. When you think they are miserable enough, the movie suddenly reverses: they are not the worst, there are worse ones. If you are rich, there must be someone richer than you; if you are poor, there must be someone poorer than you. The gap between the rich and the poor is like countless walls, dividing people into different levels. This wall stands firm in the wind, sun and rain, and does not move at all. The Park couple looks stupid, but they are getting richer and richer; Kim Ki-taek's family is smart, but they still can't turn over. You think you can get rid of your poor identity by finding a good job and having a good salary, but in fact you are still a long way away. You can wash off the sweat smell on your clothes, but you can't wash off the smell of the basement that has been integrated into your blood. You climbed ten or twenty floors, and you may just reach someone else's basement. They are bugs, so they have a hard life; they are bugs, so nothing can kill them.","Jul 30, 2024"
10,A flawless masterpiece.,"Bong Joon-ho is a South Korean filmmaker with a very diverse filmography and one who brings a distinct reputation with him when releasing a film, the Bong Hive being the name of his devoted fanbase. His latest film, Parasite, gets a long awaited release in the UK and going into this one blind is one of the best decisions you could ever make.

All unemployed, Ki-taek (Song Kang-ho) and his family take peculiar interest in the wealthy and glamorous Parks, as they ingratiate themselves into their lives and get entangled in an unexpected incident.

Parasite is an absolute triumph from Bong Joon-ho, his film building and building to a crescendo that I didn't see coming at all. It's a brilliantly written film, the humour running through the social commentary of class separation often genius throughout and the dark humour that takes things to the next level utterly breathtaking. There's a real intricacy to the screenplay, co-written by Bong and Han Jin-won, taking time to introduce us to the characters in such a way it makes what unfolds even more hard-hitting.

It isn't just the screenplay that deserves special mention for its intricacy, the production design on Parasite providing a stunning backdrop for the narrative to unfold. The time and effort that goes into making something as wonderful as the Park's family home always amazes me and it pays off majorly with its maze-like features almost serving as a character itself. Hong Kyung-pyo's sweeping cinematography through the narrow corridors and lower-class neighbourhood where the Kims actually live is beautifully neat and Yang Jin-mo's score accompanies the film with a wonderfully symphonic prowess.

Coming to the performances, Parasite is full of great performances from a cast who have been nothing but infectious this awards season. It's very much an ensemble piece, each of them getting their moment to showcase their talents but the stand-outs for me were Song Kang-ho, Park So-dam and Cho Yeo-jeong.

Parasite is Bong Joon-ho's magnum opus and has set an incredibly high bar for the rest of 2020 in film to live up to. I haven't been as fully engrossed in a film as I was watching this masterpiece unfold and I can only imagine it's going to get better with each viewing.","Feb 4, 2020"
10,Wow,Didn't have to time to watch before the Oscars. Just have and all awards duly deserved (even if there had been better competition). A movie to leave you speechless. It really is that good.,"Feb 11, 2020"
10,Wow! Stark warning of the manipulativeness of the have nots!,"Absolute cinematic masterpiece!! I felt thrust into a world exposing me to areas blurring the lines between the privileged and the marginalized. It's brilliance lies not only in its storytelling but also in its unapologetic portrayal of the lengths individuals will go to climb the social ladder.

As we explore the complexities of ""Parasite,"" a chilling realization emerges: the true parasites are not the wealthy elite but rather those who lurk in the shadows, preying on the unsuspecting. The Kim family's deception serves as a stark warning of the dangers posed by those at the bottom of the socioeconomic ladder, whose desperation drives them to resort to deceit and manipulation in pursuit of their ambitions.

Through its portrayal of the Kims' Machiavellian machinations, ""Parasite"" issues a sobering admonition to beware of the wolves in sheep's clothing lurking within our midst. The film serves as a cautionary tale, reminding audiences that privilege is not just a matter of wealth but also of naivety and vulnerability. In a world where appearances can be deceiving and trust is a scarce commodity, ""Parasite"" forces us to confront the uncomfortable truth that sometimes the greatest threats come from those closest to us.

""Parasite"" challenges conventional notions of morality and justice, presenting a provocative exploration of power dynamics and social stratification. By casting the Kim family as both protagonists and antagonists, the film subverts traditional narratives, offering a fresh perspective on the complexities of human nature. As we grapple with the implications of ""Parasite,"" its impact transcends the realm of cinema, prompting us to question our assumptions and prejudices in the face of an uncertain world.","Apr 12, 2024"
10,Parasite blew me away!,"Parasite blew me away! This South Korean movie is unlike anything I've seen before. It's funny, suspenseful, and makes you think deeply about the world.

The story follows a poor family who scheme their way into working for a super wealthy family. It's hilarious to see how they pull it off, but things get CRAZY intense as the movie goes on. The acting is phenomenal, especially Song Kang-ho who plays the dad. He's totally captivating!

This movie isn't afraid to show the huge gap between rich and poor. The rich family's mansion is amazing, while the poor family lives in a tiny underground apartment. It really makes you think!

Parasite is more than just entertaining, it's a mind-bender. There are so many twists and turns, you won't know what's coming next. If you want a movie that will stay with you for days, definitely check this one out!","Apr 20, 2024"

This movie is fantastic.

The Kim family lives in a semi-basement flat (banjiha) in Seoul, have low-income jobs, and struggle for money. Min-hyuk, a university student, gives the family a scholar's rock meant to promise wealth. Leaving to study abroad, he suggests that the Kims' son, Ki-woo, pose as a university student to take over his job as an English language tutor for Da-hye, the daughter of the rich Park family. After his sister Ki-jung helps create a false certificate for him in Photoshop, Ki-woo, posing as a Yonsei University student, is hired by the Parks.

10,Fantastic Film.,"""Parasite"" isn't just a film; it's a social commentary that probes class disparities, presenting a mirror to contemporary society. Bong's storytelling mastery navigates unexpected twists, ensuring a gripping experience that lingers long after the credits roll.

The film's universal acclaim is well-deserved, as it earned not only the Palme d'Or but also widespread admiration for its originality. Composer Jung Jae-il's haunting score further enhances the emotional depth, making ""Parasite"" an immersive journey that transcends cultural boundaries. A resounding 5-star rating for a cinematic gem that challenges conventions and leaves an indelible mark on the landscape of modern cinema.","Jan 11, 2024"
10,good,"The film had a strange atmosphere, and besides, events continued in a beautiful flow. Also, the symbolization on the smell in the movie was really great. A poor family could fix everything, make adjustments, and live a false life. But he couldn't get rid of that smell. It was the smell of the place where he lived. What they couldn't get rid of was this smell... The name of the movie could even be the smell, really! Because from my point of view, the most memorable part of the movie, that's what it was... When I was reading reviews about the film before, I personally thought that this rich family would be broken up when I heard the concept of ""family falling apart"". They will defraud the family and pull them to their side, etc. But the family that really fell apart was both... And there have been those who have said that there are no facial expressions for Koreans or something, I never agree with this. Because they are very special people who pass that feeling to us even with their eyes, their looks... The fact that they do not have obvious lines like us does not make them a failure in the acting sense. Korea is in a really great place in the TV and movie industry. I would also recommend other movies and TV series. It is especially useful to take a look at the Hong brothers' series.

When I saw Park Seo Joon at the beginning of the movie, I thought it would continue in the movie, but then I saw that he wasn't in the movie anymore, but he was the one who started the events -albeit indirectly... Betrayal, fraud, rich-poor conflict, the most obvious and soft facts.. These were all the thoughts that lay at the heart of ""parasite"".","Dec 6, 2023"
10,I found this while looking for parasyte,"I feel bad for people who refuse to watch foreign films purely because they don't want to read subtitles and whatnot because they are really missing out. For the first half of this movie it's great, just a story about a poor family who tries to integrate themselves into the lifestyle of a Rich family. The second half is like really weird though but I enjoyed it. Does it deserve all the praise it gets? Honestly I'd say yes. Like this is one of the best onscreen portrayals of economic inequality and corruption of wealth I've ever seen. The ending is brilliant, but I wouldn't even call it bong joon he's best.10/10.","Nov 19, 2023"
10,Parasite: Art in its perfect form,"Parasite is one of those films that you watch once but must rewatch it multiple times to fully understand all the content layered into the film. The film is about two families living in vastly different classes, who interact with each other in a very peculiar way. The Kim's are a poor family living in South Korea, finding any feasible way to earn enough money to get by life. The Kim's find multiple ways to work for a wealthy family, The Parks, by being housekeepers, tutors, and drivers by intentionally getting the previous workers fired through malicious acts. Through the film we come to learn that their plans of overtaking all the previous workers' positions begin to introduce complications which later leads to total chaos. I believe that this film is one of the most meaningful and most intricate films ever made. Ranging from Writing and Cinematography to the Topics covered, this film does not fail to capture every emotion intended to be displayed by the director. The theme about class in the film is very present and gives a deeper dive into how classism can affect both ends of the spectrum of class. There is also another theme about how people will use other people for their own advantage, thus the name Parasite. I will be focusing on the writing and cinematography in the film to evaluate how this film perfects ambience, mood, and the meaning of the film.

The screen writing in Parasite really helps capture the mood and tone of the movie. In the beginning of the film, we are presented with an almost comedy-like movie, where the characters are being introduced but we get a good understanding of what the characters are going through. For example, we are introduced to the Kim's which are struggling to make a living and we learn about their struggles with money and finding work, in almost an unserious way. It makes the viewer feel disconnected with their struggles. I believe the way this is presented is on purpose for the fact that we only want to be introduced to the characters, and not grow a relationship with them. Later in the movie, once we see the plans of the Kim's start to fail, we are shifted into a more serious and dark tone. It is remarkably interesting how we can go from not feeling a connection to the characters in the beginning, to feeling like we are involved in the demise of the Kim's. This switch up in emotions is possible, due to the screenwriting as well as the Cinematography.

The cinematography really captures everything the writing was not able to fully express. Throughout the film, I began to learn that The Kim's and The Park's have scenes filmed personally for each family. When we are viewing, solely the Kim's during the film, the scenes feel very intimate with the settings feeling tight and making us feel like we are involved with their every move. This really helps capture the ambience of the film. The cinematography also does an excellent job in displaying the topics covered by the film, such as class and classism. Whenever we see the Park's, we see them from a distance and in an elevated perspective, to add the affect that they are higher in class, than the Kim's. The cinematography is also able to capture the topic of class, whenever we see the families' using stairs, as when the Kim's use the stairs, they are always descending a flight of stairs and whenever the Park's use stairs, they are always ascending from it. The camera shots of these scenes capture the topic of class, as it can be interpreted that because the Kim's are in the lower class, they are descending further into poverty and the opposite for the Park's.

Overall, I believe that because of how the film's writing and cinematography perfectly captures the tone and emotions intended to be conveyed, this is a movie I recommend everyone watch at some point in their lives. There is so much meaning behind why every scene was filmed or written the way it is, and I encourage everyone to watch this film and form their own opinions about the film. This film is a refreshing take on thrillers, which leaves the viewer thinking about it for a while after watching it.","Oct 6, 2023"

10,A masterpiece directed by a true genius,"I'm just wowed by the film. It's an entertaining arthouse film that let audiences experience a variety of kinds of emotions during its screening. This satirical dark thriller talks about a sensitive issue about our society faced with inequality of wealth and class warfare through a poor family infiltrating into a rich household in the manner of what the audiences can easily get the point. Not only does this film provide you with such a poignant messages about the current times we live in but also it worths as a crowd-pleaser. Actually this film can't be referred as a specific genre in terms of its narrative and the plot that contain the elements of comedy, thriller and drama with the twists and turns. Bong again proves that he creates his own genre himself as just seen by many critics and cinephiles.","Jan 11, 2020"

10,This is so metaphorical,"Rife with metaphor and social commentary, Parasite brilliantly juxtaposes the three families portrayed through its filmography and stunning and meticulous visual construction. A black comedy, horror and thriller all at once, the film manages to transcend genres and redefine the idea of a staircase film. Each and every frame serves to emphasize the line between the two classes, and by its end, we are left wondering who the parasite referenced in the title is.

I thought some characters were a touch underdeveloped and some plot points unexplored, but I have no qualms about giving this a full 5 stars. Beautiful movie, great script, great acting, consistent style, deeply rooted themes. As near perfection as a film can be.

10,"Parasite (2019): So Engaging That You Won't Want to Get Up, with Twists That Leave You Stunned","Parasite is a film that kept me on the edge of my seat the entire time! Director Bong Joon-ho did an amazing job. The story revolves around the Kim family, who are extremely poor and desperate to infiltrate the wealthy Park family, which represents everything they aspire to be.

It starts off with humor and charm, making us laugh at the Kim family's antics. But as the story progresses, it becomes clear that ""hey, this isn't just a comedy anymore."" The tension builds steadily, keeping me glued to my seat.

What makes Parasite so fascinating is its unexpected twists. The film cleverly plays with the audience's expectations. In the beginning, we see the Kim family's struggle to integrate into the wealthy society they want to join, but as the story unfolds, everything takes a turn in a direction we never saw coming!

There's a shocking scene where we uncover a secret hidden within the Park family's home that completely changes the game. I can't describe the feeling well enough; it felt like I was on a roller coaster!

The actors in this film are fantastic! Especially Lee Sun-kyun and Choi Woo-shik, who bring depth to their characters, allowing us to understand where they come from and what they desire. The intelligent direction and beautiful cinematography enhance the film's allure. Parasite is not just a comedy or a mystery; it's also a reflection of societal issues that occur around us, cleverly using various symbols.

The story revolves around the Kim family, who ingeniously infiltrate the lives of the wealthy Park family by posing as skilled professionals. But, oh boy, things take a wild and unexpected turn that'll leave you with your jaw on the floor!

The cast is absolutely phenomenal, with each actor delivering a powerhouse performance that makes their characters feel so real you'll forget you're watching a movie. I've gotta give a special shout-out to Song Kang-ho, who plays the patriarch of the Kim family. This guy is a top-notch actor, and his performance is pure gold!

The cinematography and production design are just chef's kiss. The contrasting visuals of the poor and wealthy families add depth to the film's themes, and the attention to detail is something I couldn't help but admire.

This movie uses symbols such as the stone or smell to further explore this idea with wealthiness and the family slowly building up these fake personas to be a part of the ones the furthes up in an interesting way. This film is important in the way that we see poort and rich people and really teaches us a valuable lesson.

It shows us the importance of family and trust in a way that really gets you into the movie because you want to know about these characters, you want to explore how it is for these rich people, you want to follow them through their journey and it's just so fascinating how well this movie does this.

I've maybe watched over 200 movies now and this is by far my favourite movie of all time without a question, 10/10 babbbyyyyyy.","May 26, 2024"
10,"This is art, people!","This is a fine piece of art, a true masterpiece. The plot is unique, clever and has things and messages to give. The acting and directing is also incredible. And about the score, what can I say? It is one of the best of 2019 in cinema so good and so fitting. Don't you thing that is one difficult artfilm to watch. No it is and can be pleasant and meaningful for all the viewers even they're used to watch blockbusters or artfilms. The plot has some action in it so avoid spoiler for sure! The direction is one of my favorite right now, every film from him was a cinematic enjoyment! And this must be his finest work so far! Just don't miss it!","Jan 22, 2023"
10,A Movie That Stays with You,"""Parasite"" is an incredible movie that combines dark humor, suspense, and a powerful message about society. Bong Joon-ho does an amazing job as the director, making the story feel real and meaningful. The movie shows the differences between rich and poor in a smart and interesting way. The cast is excellent, especially Song Kang-ho, who does a great job showing the struggles of his character's family. The story is full of surprises and keeps you hooked from start to finish. It also mixes funny and emotional moments perfectly, making it unforgettable. ""Parasite"" is one of the best movies I've ever seen, and I think everyone should watch it.","Dec 10, 2024"
10,One of the best films of all time.,"Parasite is one of the greatest and most influential films of all time. It is a great thrilling satire and connects you with the characters and storyline. It is the perfect example of how beautiful a film can be and how playful it is with satire. These are one of the films you wish you could watch over and over again, a film unmasking itself each minute. This is what makes Parasite so great.

It's ratings satisfy me greatly and it deserved best picture for 2019. I absolutely love this film and I do not stammer with any other South Korean films being placed over it or fought with Parasite unless we are talking about OldBoy. Although, I prefer Parasite, the more entertaining one.","Apr 20, 2023"
10,Parasite will make you go crazy!,"I have to say, I am a big fan of this movie. I never thought that a show about a family imposing on another and keeping dark secrets hidden beneath the surface would be my style. But this moive strikes where few other do, the lack of empathy from those in higher class is definitively similar in every culture, while there are a few ""fantastic"" moments the plot is extremely relatable and to a certain extent, you can feel empathy in almost all the characters (except maybe for the rich house owners).

Parasite is fantasticly awesome and can definitively engage and entertain me. 10 out of 10 would recommend to anyone who enjoys a drama filled psychological thriller.","Nov 26, 2022"
10,You can smell it everywhere,"Just like most movie goers, I didn't know what the plot was about. Despite the urge to google it, I stayed away. Now after watching it I realized I still wouldn't have been prepared for what was ahead. A fast paced thriller centered around two families. Like two sides of a coin, they're polar opposites, yet they are crucial for the coin to spin.

Along with the unnerving feeling you have trying to figure out this movie, it's also filled with a lot humor, thrill and some family drama with a social message that is cleverly stitched into this feature. Brilliant acting and amazing set décor and intricately designed sequences make this a classic on its own.

A masterpiece by director Bong Joon Ho. He has his own directorial style and this movie is probably the best of them all. Adopting certain aspects from all his other movies while creating a uniquely critical film for ages to come, he has added his name into the directors hall of fame. He won the Oscars for best director, best original screenplay, best international film and best picture matching a 67 year old record set by Walt Disney.

If you plan to watch it, don't read about it, just latch on to the host and don't let go.","Mar 27, 2020"
10,A truly remarkable movie,"Now I've watched hundreds of movies in my life and have felt many different emotions but this one was a masterpiece.

When I was going into this movie my expectations were high seeing how highly rated it was, but, not only were my expectations met they were surpassed. For the two hours I sat watching this movie not once did I get slightly uninterested in the plot, I went through so many emotions during this movie and I was absolutely speechless during the whole movie. I could tell such hard work and thinking went into producing this and it turned out to be completely worth the watch.

It is one of my favorites and I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking to watch a great movie.","Sep 2, 2022"
10,99/100,"Parasite was a wonder to behold. The movie contained wonderful cinematography throughout, from glorious, smooth, long shots, to excellent handheld work. The film's superb visual architecture and design conveyed layers of meaning, accentuated by an incredible cast. And ultimately, though what Parasite has to say might not be anything new (class divide and difference isn't exactly a fresh topic), the way through which it conveys that story is absolutely superb. It's not reinventing the wheel, it's just making a really, really, good wheel. And in the end though, what stood out above all, was the sheer attention to detail.","Aug 30, 2022"
10,*A Masterpiece That Unravels Society's Fabric*,"From the very first frame of Bong Joon-ho's ""Parasite,"" viewers are thrust into a world that feels both familiar and unsettling. This South Korean film cleverly intertwines dark humor, drama, and social commentary, creating a cinematic experience that is as uniquely compelling as it is thought-provoking.

The narrative revolves around the Kim family, who, struggling to make ends meet in their semi-basement home, find themselves devising a cunning plan to infiltrate the lives of the wealthy Park family. What starts as a seemingly straightforward tale of class struggle rapidly morphs into a layered exploration of inequality, privilege, and the lengths one will go to for survival.

Bong's direction is nothing short of genius. He crafts a film that keeps you on the edge of your seat, continuously defying expectations. The cinematography is striking, utilizing the contrasting settings of the Kims' cramped, dilapidated quarters and the Parks' opulent dwelling to symbolize the vast chasm between the two families. Each scene is meticulously framed, capturing the essence of the characters' circumstances and their emotional states.

The performances are sublime, with each actor delivering a nuanced portrayal that adds depth to the narrative. Song Kang-ho as Kim Ki-taek epitomizes desperation and resilience, while Cho Yeo-jeong as Yeon-kyo brings a naive charm to a matriarch unaware of the deception unfolding around her. Their interactions are imbued with a palpable tension, making viewers question the morality of each character's choices.

What truly sets ""Parasite"" apart is its ability to oscillate between genres, seamlessly transitioning from drama to thriller to all-out chaos. It keeps audiences guessing, often eliciting gasps and laughter in equal measure. The film's climax is nothing short of a masterstroke, serving as a sharp indictment of social hierarchy while delivering a chilling reminder of the consequences of unchecked ambition and hunger.

In addition to its gripping narrative, ""Parasite"" leaves viewers with lingering questions about society's structure. It serves as a mirror reflecting the disparities that plague our world, urging us to confront uncomfortable realities. It challenges the audience to identify with both the oppressor and the oppressed, blurring moral lines in a way that is both unsettling and enlightening.

""Parasite"" is not merely a film; it's a cultural phenomenon that invites dialogue and introspection. It begs the question: How far are we willing to go for success, and what are we willing to sacrifice in the process? This film is a testament to the power of storytelling, proving that cinema can be both entertaining and enlightening.

""Parasite"" is a bold, original, and expertly crafted film that will resonate with viewers long after the credits roll. It is not just a tale of class struggle; it is a haunting exploration of the human condition, making it a modern classic that deserves every accolade it has received. Don't miss your chance to witness this extraordinary cinematic journey.","Jul 21, 2024"

10,Probably one of the best movies ever made,The mixture of genres is something i really enjoyed in this movie. Super tense - I didn't even ate any popcorn because I was so focused on what's going to happen next.,"Jun 1, 2022"
10,Incredible.,"Possibly the best film I've seen for some time, yes I have a few lockdown blues, and needed something to cause a bit of escapism, Parasite was the answer. It's one of those films that's almost impossibility to classify, it doesn't really fit into any specific genre, but covers almost all of them.

A great start, it holds your attention incredibly well, I enjoyed the latter stages as much as the first part of the film, I know some didn't. It just moves you into a totally different place.

You'll laugh, and cry, you'll lose yourself in the wonder. Do yourself a favour and order it, 10/10.","May 7, 2020"
10,A brave screen play,"Everything scary is going to happen slowly snd there is no fear for director to show dirty sides of humans.

The most important reason that makes the film Parasite admirable at first glance is the way Bong Jung Ho looks at the poor family in the film. Something like the look Koreida had in the movie Shoplifters. Depicting people who, although they live in the basement, although they are poor and do not have proper jobs, but they are by no means lost and hopeless people.

The basic question that is ironically expressed in the film is why a family with such intelligence is so poor and their place is underground?","Apr 1, 2023"
10,DESERVES EVERY ACCOLADE,Absolute masterpiece. Makes me want to learn Korean just so I don't have to pay as much attention to the captions! This film does a great job holding you in suspense for the entire time. I cannot recommend it enough. It's pacing done well. Multiple stories and details are woven together so beautifully!,"Apr 2, 2022"
10,No black or white characters in this one,"The Kim family is resourceful but very poor. They live in poverty in a "" banjiha"" or basement apartment. One day a family friend comes to say his goodbyes. He's going to college abroad and suggests that the son of the family should apply for his job of tutoring the oldest girl in the wealthy Park family. He tells the son that he has the knowledge, just not the credentials, and says that he will personally recommend him to the Parks. The girl in the Kim family helps create fake printed credentials for her brother via software that the Parks never question.

The son is hired, and the son then works on getting the other three members of his family hired by the Parks. First, the daughter is hired as an ""art therapist"" for the Parks' rather complex son, Da Song. The hiring of the parents, however, takes more work. That requires getting the current chauffeur and housekeeper fired by making the Parks believe something about each that is not true. Realize that the Parks don't tell either the chauffeur or the housekeeper why they've been fired, because they hate confrontation. Also know that the Parks have no idea that their four new employees are related to each other.

So the Kims are on easy street until the old housekeeper shows up while the Parks are away, saying that she needs to get in the basement because she left something behind. What she left behind sets off the second half of the film You might say that the first half plays like a light comedy, like a film about some light grifting , but that the second half is a very dark comedy.

So everybody here has both sympathetic and unlikeable qualities. All are parasites in some sense of the word. The rich family - the Parks - aren't bad people. However, they have little empathy. They look down on their servants, and they can be cruel because they don't like inconvenience and confrontation. To investigate what was going on with the servants they so casually fired would mean confrontation. So they just give generous severance to ease their minds.

The poor family -the Kims - are smart, resourceful, and they are willing to work hard. And yet they are poor. The movie shows that if you are at the bottom, it's difficult to escape poverty without faking it and without being ruthless, even being ruthless to other poor people. The 'smell' of poverty will keep you back.

The title does have a meaning. Everybody in the movie is sucking the life out of other people.","Jan 3, 2025"
10,brilliant,"A superb film, very funny with a fair few twists and turns. Great acting with an original and innovative script. Watch this film, I promise you that you won't regret it.","Apr 21, 2022"
10,Would've been a perfect movie if it wasn't for...,"I absolutely loved this movie, the idea, the theme, acting was incredible. It was completely original, and you didn't see the twist coming. The story had a few loose ends that it tied up in the end.

This would've been a perfect movie if it wasn't for the sex.

If you're gonna put sex in movies, you need to have a good reason. This movie didn't have a good reason. That scene where the Kim family was hiding in the shadows while the Parks were on the couch watching their kid and engaging in sexual behavior, was not necessary, at least the sexual behavior was not necessary. This would've been a perfect movie without that. I'm the kind of person who doesn't like that content in movies and seeing that scene in this movie almost ruined it.

This movie was one of a kind, it was so good, but that one scene with the Parks, did not need to happen. And that is why I rated 9/10.","Dec 26, 2023"
10,A Perfect Flow,"This movie's all of scene move on step by step. It's like a crime noval; always a twist appear and general flow is so fluent, you always be cruise about next step. Out of this; Film tells it's story with a rally striking way. Such that sometimes I was thrilled to death. Even it's sometimes move away from the reality, it's can keep on the main idea. End of the day those factors reveal a realy good movie.","Apr 16, 2022"
10,Parasite,"Thrillingly played by a flawless ensemble cast who hit every note and harmonic resonance of Bong and co-writer Han Jin-won's multi tonal script, it's a tragicomic masterclass that will get under your skin and eat away at your cinematic soul.","Jan 28, 2022"
10,🙌🏻,"The film doesn't just 'make you think', it opens up the brain. You leave the hall on wobbly legs and do not perceive reality for a long time. 'Parasite' deserves every second of that 15 minute standing ovation at the festival and so much more. This must be watched, because this is not a tragicomedy, this is life - beautiful and disgusting at the same time, but very instructive and 'metaphorical'.

Love your family, make honest plans, and don't take what doesn't belong to you.","Jan 19, 2022"
10,History about parasites(people),"Slack in the plot and the blurring of the overall message, which is quite understandable, but weakly beaten, leave the attentive viewer with a number of questions rather than viewing satisfaction. However, the series may be of interest to the work of artists and actors, and can also be useful as a first step in getting acquainted with Korean cinema (although for many it has already been overtaken by Parasite in this regard).","Jan 19, 2022"
10,Worth it,"I hesitated for a long time before watching. Is it worth watching something not made in the USA, worth it! A very unusual strong film, I guarantee that you will revise it more than once. The connection is very odd.","Jan 19, 2022"
10,Best movie😍,"Possibly the best movie I've ever seen, yes I have a few sad thoughts about quarantine and I needed something to spark some interest, Parasite was the answer. It's one of those movies that's almost impossible to classify, it doesn't fit into any particular genre, but covers almost all of them.

Great start, it holds your attention incredibly well, I liked the last stages as much as the first part of the movie, I know some didn't. It just takes you to a completely different place.

10,Movie,"The main character was lucky - he got a job as a tutor for a girl in a Pack family. Gradually, he comes up with a scam and drags his whole family to work, substituting the servants. So they live and work until one day everything turned upside down, but I will not reveal the secret - see for yourself, but the plot and the script are of course top class!!!

I want to praise the actors, they played great, I'm not a fan of Korean movies and dramas, so I don't know a single actor))))). The actor who played the main character was also filmed on a train to Busan.

Separately, I will praise the operator and beautiful Korea: the city and the Pak mansion, I want to build myself the same)), with a huge window and access to the lawn directly from the hall. Interestingly, the contrast of the view from the window is shown, some have a beautiful lawn with trees, others have a lattice in the basement and pissing people.","Jan 19, 2022"
10,Worth the Hype,"This film is honestly a masterpiece. The plot is not complex yet incredible, making the audience feel so deeply intangled in the movie.

It makes you appreciate the intelligence of the director with the cuts and methods of filming that you wouldn't even realise has an impact on your overall feel of the film.

Other critics exclaiming it is overhyped or cry that we are supposed to feel a certain type of way, are not open minded at all. There is no type of way we SHOULD specifically feel about the characters in this film, and they do not appreciate the simplicity yet grasping nature of this film.","May 19, 2024"
10,An Epic Interesting Film,"This is a film that has been in the news lately as it picked up 4 Oscars including Best Director & Best Picture which is huge for a non english speaking film. I have now had the chance to see the film and this is my review for the film. The premise of the film sees a poor family look to gain an opportunity by gaining jobs in a higher class family and gain the advantages from that.

Main Character Now there are quite a few characters in this film but really Woo-Sik Choi plays the son in the family and he does a great job in the film, you can see he has pretty honest intentions at first but things start to unravel for him and he doesn't quite know what to do. He is likeable but you aren't sure if you should root for him and that creates a multi layered character that keeps you interested throughout.

Supporting Characters Everybody gives a superb performance in the film, I won't go through everybody's names as they are quite long but whether it is the poor family or the rich family everybody is believeable and real in the film. These characters are as mentioned before multi layered and you just aren't exactly sure who exactly to root for. The one actor I will mention is Kang-Ho Song as the Father of the poor family, he is truly brilliant in this film, he probably goes through the most in this film and he is the most interesting person in this film and honestly he should have probably got nominated for the Best Supporting Actor at The Oscars but nonetheless he is great in this film.

Story The first 20 minutes of this film I wasn't exactly sure where this film was going but it is super fascinating watching the dynamics between the two families and seeing the different personalities and motivations which really blurs the line. I don't want to go into the plot too much as I had no idea what this film was about before I watched it so it should be the same for you. Also to put it on top the ending for this movie is so thought provoking and perfect for the film that has been going on.

Script The script even though in Korean is brilliant, this film suprisingly has tons of humour in it, I laughed quite a bit in this film which shows just how well the writing is to make these characters feel multi dimensional. The drama also really works to make you truly care about what is going on and what is happening to the characters that you are watching.

Style First of all lets mention that obviously this film has subtitles, this should not be something to worry about as it is fine and the film is so strong that it doesn't matter. Okay this film has a bit of everything in a stylistic way, it looks great and has bits of comedy, thriller, drama & horror, it is a perfect blend that keeps you on the edge of your seat and excited to see what comes next.

Overall Overall, this is one of the best films I have seen in the last few years, it just has a bit of everything to it and was well worthy of its Best Picture win at the Oscars. If you are put off by foreign films and reading subtitles, don't be as this is a truly special film that has to be seen to truly appreciate just how good it really is.

Rating - 10/10.","Dec 12, 2021"
10,JUST WATCH IT,"This film is amazing. I don't even know where to start! My attention was captivated the entire time - character development, plot development, cinematography, writing, everything was phenomenal.

To write anything more would spoil it... just watch this film!","Jan 21, 2022"

10,Simply WOW,"This movie is pretty much perfection. It makes you go through literally every emotion imaginable. You will fear, you will laugh, you will be happy, you will be devastated, you will be shocked. You never know where the story will take you next. The actors are phenomenal. The scenario is simple, soooo simple, yet so effective. You follow this family struggling to make enough money, but one day, the son is able to get hired by a rich family to teach English to their daughter. I would tell you more, but I really don't want to spoil anything, not the slightest thing, because I want you to enjoy the movie as I did, knowing nothing. Just trust me, it's worth every second.

10,Goes bigger by going smaller,"Bong Joo Ho has been making ingenious social commentary for some time. That is not new. But this film reaches new heights, not through more extravagant plot but through a more naturalistic approach. As a result, the comedy, the stakes, and the insights here are at a different level. You care about the protagonists, and you feel the weight of their struggle. All the same ingredients are there (the social satire, the violence, the bizarre twists, the brilliant direction), but there's a new weight to this film. I don't think ""masterpiece"" is too strong, and I'm looking forward to watching it again some time soon.","Nov 4, 2019"
10,The best film of the 21st century,"Parasite (2019) is a masterpiece at it´s finest. There is clearly no surprise that it won 4 Academy Awards.

My favorite part of the film was 100% the cinemaphotography, this movie is art, and that's thanks to the cinemaphotography. Every angle isn´t lazy. It´s well made and the director Bong Joon Ho took every chance possible to put his vision on the big screen.

Another amazing thing is the acting. The actors put the best performance possible. From dramatic scenes, to intense scenes and to horror scenes.

Now some people might not like the ending, but it had me amazed. It shows also how unpredictable this film is.

It also shows how everyone isn´t who they say they are. Even if its just small things.

This film is amazing and if you haven´t seen it, then I highly recommend it. (unless you cant handle violence) if not, then watch it.","Oct 19, 2021"

10,a masterpiece on class relations,"Draws you in with a scheming family trying to make it and unfolds into an incredible and biting film of social commentary. Using a brilliant embedded visual metaphor of vertical space for class relations, there is always more underneath than what you see. The film has a pace that reaches fever pitch and packs a punch of shock and serious reflection.","Feb 15, 2021"
10,Parasite,"This Oscar winning Korean film is centred on the Kim family; they live in a distinctly downmarket neighbourhood and struggle to earn enough money. One day a friend of Ki-woo, the son, tells him of a job opportunity; the wealthy Park family need an English tutor for their teenaged daughter. Equipped with forged qualifications he gets the job, not only that he suggests that his sister, Ki-jung, who he introduces as a cousin of a friend would be the ideal art tutor for their son. It isn't long before Father, Ki-taek, and mother, Chung-sook, are also employed as driver and housekeeper... all this is done in a way that doesn't give away that they know each other. Things are looking up for the Kims as they enjoy their new situation; then the old house keeper, who they got fired, returns and their new success is threatened in a surprising way.

This film is hard to pigeonhole; it is a comedy that provides plenty of laughs; it is a social commentary of the vast difference in wealth in Korean society; it toys with horror tropes; there is some romance; and has violent moments. It could have turned out to be a real mess but the elements blend together almost perfectly. The cast does a really fine job making the characters believable even when the situation is far-fetched. For the most part it is set within the Park's large, modern house; the only other location of note it the contrastingly small basement flat the Kim's call home... the comparison emphasises who different the families' circumstances are. The story provides some twists, which I won't spoil here; these often lead to a shift in tone... even when things turn darker in tone there are still laughs to be had. Director Bong Joon-ho, who also co-wrote the story, does a great job as the film treads the fine line between brilliance and silliness... always keeping on just the right side. Overall I'd definitely recommend this to anybody looking for something a little different.

These comments are based on watching the film in Korean with English subtitles.","Oct 26, 2020"
10,Who is the real Parasite? The rich or the poor.,"A foreign film that won four Oscars is unheard of. In 2020, the film Parasite directed by Bong Joon-Ho won Best Picture, Best Director, Best Original Screenplay, and Best International Feature Film. During this time many Asians and Asian-American people were facing a lot of racism because of Covid and much other generational racism, therefore it was a very BIG deal that a foreign film that was all in Korean with an all-Korean cast was winning Oscars back-to-back. It was a tremendous accomplishment, especially considering the Academy Awards have been chastised for being racially biased against persons of color and for failing to recognize Asian actors. Parasite is set in a modern-day society in the city of Seoul, the film shows the dark reality of societal structures. The Park family, a working-class family cunning their way into the Kim home. The Kim family, a wealthy family, clinging to the working class by living comfortably off the backs of their labor. The movie Parasite critiques societal class and shows us how two classes can co-exist but never interact.

The stairs, which depict how the Parks and the Kims are separated and show the double meaning of societal class distinction, are one of the primary symbols in the movie Parasite. The depiction of stairs in this film is quite repetitive; there are stairs in practically every scene, especially as the plot begins. For instance, to go into the Parks' house, you must descend the stairs, while to get into the Kims' home, you must ascend the steps. To illustrate, there's a scene where there's a rainstorm and the Parks have to hurry from the Kims' house to theirs because it's flooding, and we can see how far the Parks reside from the Kims at this point. The cameras are filming the Parks as they descend the steps that lead to their neighborhood. Every scene shot during this period depicts the Parks going down the stairs, which represents their stance in societal class. The rain was a curse for the Parks, but a blessing for the Kims, who found the rain to be beautiful and allowed for the sky to be blue and clear the next morning. I appreciated how Bong Joon-Ho took his time to outline the symbolism of the stairs and show how two different families viewed the rainstorm. It gives the rich-poor divide a whole new level of significance.

This film was beautifully crafted, the direction of the cinematography captures the stillness of the scenes and it is also able to capture the expressions of characters and we're able to understand how something makes them feel. Majority of the film is set inside the Kim's family estate, an architectural wonder. There's a scene where Ki-woo (Choi Woo-shik), the main character's son from a working-class family, pays a visit to Kim's home. On his way to the house, the camera captures him walking up a hill, from which we can see a wealthy neighborhood. The angles make Ki-woo appear small in comparison to the big houses, emphasizing how Ki-woo is looked down upon and how unattainable this lifestyle is for him. The visual composition of the daylight depicts a better way of life, as represented by the Kims, whereas the basements and crowded streets depict how life feels trapped, as portrayed by the Parks. The cinematography undoubtedly supports the film's plot and the direction that director Bong Joon-Ho was pursuing.

Typically Hollywood films portray the less fortunate families as fools. For instance, Joker (2019) was an outcast; the rich would always promise him assistance, but Arthur (Joaquin Phoenix) Joker's real name never received assistance and was constantly exploited. As a result, he harbored a grudge against the wealthy. However, in Parasite, the Parks are incredibly intelligent because they don't have the resources of a wealthy family. The Parks are essentially scavengers, which necessitates a high level of intelligence. Many terrifying events occur in the Kims' home. The story has a Stephen King vibe, however, his typical American suburban life is replaced with a capitalist social class in Seoul. Although the film is initially amusing and contains some extremely clever jokes, the plot shifts, and the film becomes less amusing and more serious. When you watch the film, you can't help but think that anything like that could happen, which is unnerving.

Parasite is a brilliant movie, flawlessly shot and the actors did a phenomenal job portraying their characters. It shows a great depiction of how the working class is compelled to compete with one another, while families like the Parks enjoy a comforting life of leisure. Described by Bong Joon-Ho Parasite is ""a comedy without clowns, a tragedy without villains."" This film did an excellent job of delving into the characters' personalities, desires, and pain. Its serious message is delivered effectively while maintaining a dark horror tone. This film kept me on the edge of my seat, mesmerized me, and kept me guessing about the beginning, middle, and end. The collateral crossovers between the families, as well as the overall meaning of the film, continue to pique my interest. Who is the real parasite? The rich or the poor.","Oct 5, 2021"
10,"Parasite has a unique originality, unmissable, strong, intriguing ...","We can say that it is a film without a defined genre, even though it is practically a rule within the seventh art to have a definition if the plot is a comedy, drama, suspense, adventure or any other, parasite breaks this rule in a stupendous way.

We have a good photograph, we have Oscar-worthy performances, a breathtaking suspense, with heavy scenes, like falling down the stairs and stoned on the head , sometimes with some comic relief but nothing compares to the script and direction.

In a current cinematographic world without originality we see a parasite, which we see a father of the family ki taek ( song kang ho ) unemployed killing a parasitic insect , which we can think of as if it were a spoiler from the end, but in reality he and his family end up playing this role, deceiving and lying in order to suck financial power and gradually take over the upper class family home. With a direction that manages to place all these gender elements mentioned above in a single work in a masterful way , placing more abstract and intriguing motifs ( like the stone carried by the English instructor son, how to place the upper class house on top and when the family ""parasites"" he needs to return to his home in the flood and he descends all the time, as if he were returning to his former social class , with the vomit in a toilet and exploding the water outlet in the other toilet, all with magnificent edition.

But nothing compared to the script, exactly everything fits here, all the motives of all the characters , being an upper class family with one child paying more attention than the other for having had a trauma of having seen a ghost, the daughter alone , and sad that he has an emotional need being taken advantage of by the son of the parasitic family instructor of English who takes the opportunity to integrate his whole family with functions as a driver, housekeeper and arts instructor ... we see that there were parasites in the family, they just stayed and switched places ... Parasite has a unique originality, unmissable, strong, intriguing and makes us hope all the time that the parasites are not discovered.","Sep 29, 2022"
10,Brilliant!,"This show is really really exquisite in terms of defining the privilege of upper class and the severity of being in the lower class. At the end of the movie, you would truly question your existence and the inevitable presence of modern society that we would be living in.

10,A movie for fussy watchers,"Ok, let's start with why I liked this movie.

To be honest, I'm more of a horror, thriller person. I'm a fan of hereditary and Midsommar. But this might be one the movies that changed my cinematic experience forever.

Firstly, the plot and story is genius. This movie expands into a realistic yet terrifyingly accurate world. The movie of course is carried on the idea of the treatment of class in our modern day society. The 1st half and 2nd half and two sides on this complex story of a symbiotic relationship. Amazing movie!

Highly recommend this movie for anyone who wants to be surprised at a movie!!","Sep 24, 2021"
10,One of the best movie I've ever watched!,So many different emotions in this film. The director very well highlighted the theme of the movie and also made it spectacular to watch. Definitely worth a watch.,"Aug 26, 2021"
10,This movie is so traumatizing,"This movie is so traumatizing that I had to stop at one hour and resume its viewing the next day, but guess what: the second half of the film is even worse, in a GREAT way...","Oct 18, 2021"
10,Parasite (2019) Review,"This film was well made and thought provoking. It is a social commentary on how the rich are ignorant of the struggles of poor people, leeching off of them without considering the negative effects it has on them. This element of the story was displayed in a unique and disturbing way that escalated in the shocking and bloody climax. Unfortunately, this film in my opinion wasn't as groundbreaking and masterful as the critics said it was. It winked at the revenant issues in society without instigating change. None of the people in the movie who were victims of this evil cycle did anything about their predicament to start helping others (The rich) and get out of their situation by accessible community college means (The poor). Despite the critic hype and intelligently displayed class war at the heart of the story, it felt as if it used the same rinsed and recycled props, sub-plots, downfalls, cliches, and unfortunate endings to display an ongoing problem in our society that has yet to be changed. This movie isn't really asking for change, it is just putting people against each other, still oblivious to the situation, rather then showing activism and improving the welfare of others.","Apr 28, 2022"
10,Prolly one of the best movies I've ever watched,"This movie knocked me the heck out , I watched half the movie with my hand on my mouth , couldn't handle the tension in every scene , the cinematography genius or this crazy plot.","Nov 11, 2021"
10,Brilliant,"This movie kept me on the edge of my seat and my heart was racing in every scene. It has elements of all genres from comedy, suspense and thriller. After the movie ended I was speechless, it even brought me to tears and I still don't know why. The director successfully makes the viewers feel like they are part of the movie but also gets a message across about the standards of living for lower class Koreans. I had never heard of this director but after seeing Paradite, I'll be sure to check out his other movies!","Aug 7, 2021"
10,perfect,I seen this movie about a year ago now & i still think about it almost daily.,"Oct 4, 2021"
10,Perhaps the best movie about class-struggle ever?,"While Parasite spends a good amount of time on comedy, it nonetheless presents an extremely nuanced take on the struggle of Rich Vs. Poor, with neither side painted as entirely good or entirely bad.","Aug 2, 2021"
10,It will make you feel the pure art and beauty of cinema,Nothing much....a pure sign of deep art. An amazing artistic pattern that will leave you speechless..,"Oct 2, 2021"
10,Its Everything,"Movies have always had a certain point of perspective or a certain ressemblance, but not Parasite. Its like nothing else before, its not only a comedy, its also a horror, drama and a thriller with a great message behind it. The acting is good i feel, but of course i cant tell perfectly because i dont understand Korean. The reason this movie is good is because of its spontaneous and ambiguity. Film writters often do films where they answer all the question in your asking yourself about the story. But in those case, you watch the movie and you dont really think about it afterwards because often those answer are boring or too simple. But in this case, the film is good because it dives into something relatively ordinary but always make you wonder if there is something more to it. The way the events occur are nothing like any other movie. It has a marvelous ending with full of sense. I really like the way the director portrays the simple emotions of life and the class of society. If you are open to new ideas and new way of looking at a story you may like Parasite.","May 21, 2022"
10,"""It's so Metaphorical""","A true remarkable achievement in every aspect.

There's so much about this movie. Name a genre; it's in it. Let it be comedy, mystery, thriller, romance, suspence, drama ; Parasite covered everything.

The film keeps developing and the excitement for the upcomings never ends with multiple twists and turns. The film speaks so much about the class differences, mentalities of people having different living style to the hatred towards the people who are suffering in life. Even if we don't want to jump into those political statements, we can thoroughly enjoy the film to its core. Parasite is rare and original .","Sep 9, 2021"

10,"Unique, entertaining,good","Awesome! First I was skeptical cause it wasnt an english movie. Then I thought! Why not watch it, it has high ratings. And I have been watching some real bad hollywood /American movies lately.

Watch it indeed! You will be entertained, its a good movie and with good gore material! A mix of emotions will linger on with you long after the movie ends.","Nov 1, 2021"
10,One of the best films ever,"Parasite is one of those movies were you can sit down and let it surprise you. The script reminds me of Billy Wilder. It switches from comedy to drama because life is like that. The directing is flawless, Acting is compelling. But the most important thing is how it illustrates the sad society we've come to create in the XXI century, with no social mobility. It is fatalistic because bettering yourself nowadays is practically impossible.

This film must be seen by anyone who loves movies. It is one that will stand the test of time. Hollywood be worried with your generic formulas, Korea is the new power house and Parasite is the culminations of years of doing things right. American audiences should read subtitles for once. This movie will make you laugh and cry. The story falls into place like this perfect unpredictable puzzle. It's a must watch. A masterpiece.","Oct 21, 2019"

10,10/10,"The Kims - mother and father Chung-sook and Ki-taek, and their young adult children, son Ki-woo and daughter Ki-jung - are a poor family who live in a squalid, cramped apartment in the middle of a basement in a commercial busy working class. Seoul district. Without even knowing it, they, especially Mr. And Mrs. Kim, literally reek of poverty. Often, as a collective, they commit small tricks to survive and, even when they have jobs, they do the minimum amount of work necessary. Ki-woo is the one who dreams of breaking out of poverty by going to university one day. Despite not having a college education, Ki-woo is chosen by his college student friend Min, who is leaving for school, to take up his tutoring job for Park Da-hye, whom Min plans to date once he returns to Seoul and she herself is at university. The Parks are a wealthy family who for four years lived in their modernist designed house and former residence of the famous architect Namgoong. While Mr. And Mrs. Park are about status, Mrs. Park has a shifty, simple-minded mentality and temperament, which Min tells Ki-woo to feel comfortable lying to her about her education to get the job. Upon getting the job, Ki-woo further discovers that Ms. Park is looking for an art therapist for Parks' teenage son Da-song, Ki-woo quickly recommending her professional art therapist friend ""Jessica"", actually Ki -jung that he knows he can be the easiest liar of the four Kims. In Ki-woo also falling in love with Da-hye, he starts imagining himself in that house and so the Kims as a collective initiate a plan for all Kims, like Ki-jung using false names, to replace the existing servants in the Parks' employ in orchestrating reasons for being fired. The hardest one to get rid of might be Moon-gwang, the Parks housekeeper who literally came with the house - she was Namgoong's housekeeper when he used to live there - and therefore knows her every nook and cranny better than he does. Parks. The question then is how far the Kims can take this blow in their quest to become their version of the Parks.","Jul 16, 2021"
10,One of the best movie I've ever watched,"A true masterpiece from Director Bong Joon Ho.

I've watched this movie more than 10 times now and still amazed every time I see it, The attention to every single detail is unbelievable.

Director Bong really stick to the Chekov's Gun rule. Every element from the start until to end connects with each other. Every scene is necessary.

The cinematography and production design really helped the contrast of the Kim's and Park's family.

Recommend to watch both color and black and white version. The black and white gives it more contrast and texture, but some scenes doesn't really work because yet this movie wasn't intended to be a black and white film.","Jul 15, 2021"
10,"Virtually flawless, visually perfect and eerie and tense","""Parasite"" is truly a modern masterpiece. For those who don't know, the film released in 2019 to immediate acclaim, winning several awards, and for good reason. The plot follows a poor family and a rich family in Korea. The poor family live underground in a tiny apartment sized home, with little food and luxuries. On the other hand, the richer family lives in a beautiful, futuristic home that looks like something out of a Stanley Kubrick film like ""A Clockwork Orange"" due to its intriguing architecture and design. Anyway, the son in the poor family receives a request from a friend to work at the rich family home. He agrees, and as the story goes on, the poor family forges a plan to purposely eliminate and fire every other worker at the house to be the exclusive workers. Their plan works, in a wacky and comical way. However, it becomes more of a thriller and even horror once the house's basement is revealed to have a man hiding within, the husband of one of the previous workers. It begins to go downhill, and that's when the film peaks and became one of my all time favorites.

Overall, it is a must watch for any movie fan or student! 10/10.","Oct 9, 2023"
10,It was so unexpected,"It was so unpredictable, such a twist, so off the rails into the stratosphere, it's just - wow. Utterly a roller-coaster.

I never would have expected something like this from a Korean movie - it's just not how they usually feel to me, it's more something like Seth MacFarlane does in his Family Guy or American Dad.

It's serious, meaningful, so alive, and so tragic, so heart-breaking and so terrifying. And in the same time kinda light and funny. It never an overdose of either emotion, it's just enough to enjoy their somewhat sharp sensation. I just usually like those things, and this one is perfectly done, perfectly balanced, spiced and fresh.","Jun 28, 2021"
10,Attention-grabbing masterwork,"One of the best movies I've ever seen in my whole life! I'm not into a Korean film making, but this masterpiece blew my mind! It's actually impossible to categorise it cuz it includes many diverse genres - slasher, suspense, drama, comedy, thriller... To my mind, all the cast delivered a great performance! So eye-catching contrast between wealthy and working-class people who have different needs, outlooks and values. The director extraordinarily carried this out! Impeccable!","Jun 27, 2021"
10,This movie teases your mind for days after watching it!,"Parasite is the kind of movie that can take place in multiple movie genres. Like Dark comedy, thriller, a slight horror, mystery etc.

All the characters are awesome and this movie shows the that Rich and Poor have a parasitic relationship with each other. Social class discrimination between the two results in horrific results.

Bong Jun-Hoo did his best to show the sad reality of a Metropolitan city in which there are huge class differences. His efforts resulted in The First Non-English Movie to win 'Best Picture Oscar'.

Truly impressive and thought provoking.","Sep 10, 2021"

Movie should be like this. I will give it 10/10.","Jun 27, 2021"
10,Loved it!,"This is very amazing movie...fun.thriller,sadness is there in overall movie..This is well written and well performed original film. The naretive and the actors were excellent . Parasite has made me think more than most films i have seen. They quite clearly cross the line, and when I mean ""they"" I mean bother the working class and upper class. You could easily argue that ""parasite"" refers to one family trying to suck another family dry. Or that the upper class is draining the labour of the lower class, and expecting them to be greatful about it too!

Give it watch , see it with friends or family Members... you'll enjoy this movie a lot.","Jun 25, 2021"
10,Movie of the decade.,"Yet another adrenaline-filled , suspense thriller by the director Bong Joon-Ho , the master director of thriller movies.

The movie is set in South Korea depicting two families and their ways Parasite follows the Kim's family struggling to make ends meet until his son Ki-woo comes across an unexpected opportunity. With no experience in teaching English, he decides to accept a job tutoring Da-hye, a daughter from the wealthy Park family. And thus, a mission ensues for the entire Kim family to intrude the lavish household.

One by one, each family member secures a job under the guise that they're vaguely connected through mutual contacts. And although the two families eventually settle into a give-and-take relationship of service and riches, there is an unforeseen parasite that threatens to destroy it all by exposing the truth.

The film is brilliantly written and directed and it covers the very minute details.

It shows the conflict between the rich and the poor and the difference in their lives and problems. It is a roller coaster ride of all the emotions combined together and will absorb you into its world of thrill.

I would strongly recommend this movie to all the viewers seeking the depth of suspense.","Jun 24, 2021"
10,Edge of the seat-thrilling-masterpiece.,"Parasite is a well crafted movie which grips the audience and push them deeper into the plot and shakes them in a manner they couldn't imagine. The movie is both entertaining and deep thinking. The message of the movie is quite well depicted almost every scene. The class difference is wonderfully shown whether by the steep stairs of the society or that of the basement. The best part about the film is that if you want to watch it just for entertainment you have it. If you want to think deep , you have it. If you want to get thrilled, you have it. The screenplay is exceptional as well as the background score. The characters are vibrant and contrasting. The film will leave you emotional despite being a thriller-comedy. If this isn't a masterpiece then there's no masterpiece. This movie is a sure 10/10.","Jun 17, 2021"

10,Think about what you are doing with your life,"Are you a parasite? Who is the parasite?

This movie is absurdly great, it gets you by the balls and makes you feel everything they planned you too feel. True poetry does this. It guides you to explain exactly what you need to understand, both logically and sentimentally. This was written by a true artist that not only understands the topic at hand but has a deep knowledge about the medium and visual language.

Parasite takes you to another reality, it is raw and yet it hides its rawness through comedy, masticated just enough so you can feel comfortable at first. This is exactly how society is, you are in your home, sitting on a chair or lying in your bed, reading this comment on your thousand dollar computer of phone, full belly, warm, relaxed. The comedy gets you instantly. Light, easy to grasp, easy to follow along. And then, when it hits you, it hits hard, it hits where it matters. The movie prepares you, hints you where it is going to hit, but you are NOT READY. You receive these hints every day, every time. You walk on the streets, you see it, you ignore it. You ignore people, you ignore hunger, poverty, death. Yet, it is all there. Suffering never stops. Never. And yet, you try to be comfortable, you struggle to find behaviors in you that can clear your ego. You protect yourself and hide yourself from reality, consume large amounts of soft sweet warm media, consult with top-notch psychologists, have pets, great food, great internet, great movies, great distractions. This movie is about this, you, us, our distractions. It is a conversation that needs to happen and for this reason I recommend you stop everything now and watch this movie. Thanks.","Jun 7, 2020"
10,"Gripping, masterfully crafted thriller with a clever streak of black comedy","There are a lot of words that can be used to describe director Bong Joon Ho's Parasite. It is equally parts darkly humorous, thought provoking, relatable, and frightening.

The first half of the film plays out like a wickedly diabolical black comedy. As the cunning, yet relatable underclass Kim family deviously schemes to infiltrate the much wealthier and more fortunate Park family.

The kim family's deceitful schemes are portrayed as slightly mean spirited but also deeply relatable. We understand why the Kim family is doing what they are doing. Their situation is horrible. They live in a claustrophobic, bug infested, dirty house and (despite being hard working and intelligent) barely make enough money to make ends meet. Yet, the film somehow never feels as if it is openly supporting what the family is doing.

The awful and desperate nature of the kim family's lives, (along with how it contrasts with the much more lavish, carefree life of the Park family) is brilliantly conveyed through the film's masterful cinematography. The camerawork and lighting is at times surreally beautiful and at other times horribly uncomfortable to look at.

You feel the claustraphobia and discomfort that the Kim family must endure in their own home everyday of their lives and their desperate longing to experience a fleeting glimpse of the life of comfort that the Park's live.

As a result, though you do not necessarily agree with the actions of the Kims, it is easy to delight in their perverse exploitation of the rich and powerful. This is rather obviously where most of the film's memorable comedy derives from. Delivered through a witty and cleverly written script, the comedic side of the film is incredibly entertaining and becomes even more so on repeat viewings due to the more subtle aspects of it.

This rather light hearted and satirical tone completely changes in the film's second and third acts through the introduction of a shocking, riveting, and complex plot twist that makes you question everything you found delightful about the first act.

The film is very suspenseful, intense and morally gray in this second half. You genuinely have no idea which characters are in the right or wrong, and the tension continues building until the film's hauntingly dreadful conclusion.

Overall, Parasite is an incredible film in every aspect. The acting is exceptional across the board with every actor turning in relatable and undeniably human preformances. The characters are superbly written with realistic and very relatable goals and motivations. The world of Parasite feels remarkably well realized and lived in. And the entire film is thoroughly entertaining and nail-biting while also managing to be endlessly complex and thought provoking. In short, it is nothing short of a masterpiece. A film everyone should see at least once.","Jan 23, 2023"

10,An extremely intriguing tale,"Having just rewatch the movie again last night, I'm again confirmed with why this title was my personal best movie of 2019. Even on second viewing, there isn't a single boring minute. The tale captures you from the very beginning and makes you feel heavily invested in the story right away.

The first hour is gleefully entertaining, showing the poor family put on a scam scheme. When you see it unfolds, it just leaves you with a smile on your face and laughing along with their execution. And this uplifting charm helps so much more for the impact of the second half of the movie. Not getting into spoilers, but this build up is well worth it.

Overall the movie is simply a viewing pleasure. Great acting, excellent story and cinematography filled with symbolism. An irreverent tale of class differences I would highly recommend anyone to give it a watch.","Mar 21, 2020"

The class differences you can see with both sides of the family is really telling of the modern wealth inequality around the world.

10,"This is just a well done film that is very compelling, smart, entertaining and worth your time.","Parasite (2019) is a movie we saw in theatres as soon as it was released. The storyline involves a family down on their luck and funds when they find an opportunity they can't pass up. They've been asked to house sit for a wealthy family while on vacation and have strict rules on how they need to take care of the house. Each member of the family lies to the wealthy family and takes a role within their household. When the family comes back from their trip early, the working family needs to work really hard to hide their scheming ways; unfortunately for them, there may be secrets going on all around them they could have never anticipated. This movie is directed by Bong Joon Ho (Snowpiercer) and stars Kang-ho Song (The Host), Sun-kyun Lee (A Hard Day), Yeo-jeong Cho (The Concubine) and Woo-sik Choi (Train to Busan). The storyline for this is awesome and very well paced. The character development and interactions throughout the film was perfect and the cast had great chemistry. The body language and dialogue throughout the film is creepy and well executed and the sudden intensity at the end of the movie was awesome.

Even some of the 4 and 5 star reviews makes it clear these people did not watch this film or partially watched it with one eye on their Instagram feed or simply don't know what they're talking about. Well, it won Best Picture of the Year at the Oscar's becoming the first foreign film to accomplish that, and well deserved. So much for the few low reviews. This movie is a rare moment in modern cinema considering how bad movies have been in recent years coming out of Hollywood. South Korea may singlehandedly save American cinema by reminding them how to make a spectacular movie. Let me be clear, it's the best movie of the last decade. Period.

Do you want to see a movie that will have you conflicted on who you're rooting for? Regardless of your answers, see Parasite. Parasite ticks along quietly until it is booming in your ears. The symbolism varies. Sometimes it is obvious, Bong Joon-ho might as well have made the subtitles spell it out. But other times it is more subtle, and you might realize a connection or symbolism days or weeks after. Bong Joon-ho is a master at that. The conversation that it sparks is worth the $13-20 it costs to see the film. Parasite has made me think more than most films I've seen. Give it a watch, see it with friends or family and the dinner table will have a conversation overflowing with opinions and realizations.","Jun 18, 2021"
10,Perfect Storytelling,"Storytelling is one of the most important elements of a good movie, and parasite is a perfect example. From the beginning we see everything wrong with the lifestyle of our main characters. We follow their individual character arcs through to the end. This is a complex movie with many subplots and ideas with deep symbolism, yet I was never confused or overwhelmed. Fantastic worldview with such a great developing plot with such interesting elements every scene.","Jul 13, 2022"
10,10/10,"The Kims - mother and father Chung-sook and Ki-taek, and their young adult offspring, son Ki-woo and daughter Ki-jung - are a poor family living in a shabby and cramped half basement apartment in a busy lower working class commercial district of Seoul. Without even knowing it, they, especially Mr. And Mrs. Kim, literally smell of poverty. Often as a collective, they perpetrate minor scams to get by, and even when they have jobs, they do the minimum work required. Ki-woo is the one who has dreams of getting out of poverty by one day going to university. Despite not having that university education, Ki-woo is chosen by his university student friend Min, who is leaving to go to school, to take over his tutoring job to Park Da-hye, who Min plans to date once he returns to Seoul and she herself is in university. The Parks are a wealthy family who for four years have lived in their modernistic house designed by and the former residence of famed architect Namgoong. While Mr. And Mrs. Park ...","Apr 9, 2021"
10,Best film of 2019,Parasite is one of the best films I have seen this decade I would highly recommend it to anyone.,"Apr 9, 2021"
10,I avoided this film far too long! Silly of me.,"First off - I don't remember the last time I gave a film 10 stars. 99.9% of movies and films these days don't deserve 10 stars. Perfection in film is near impossible. That's why this film is so ........ magical and maddening on so many levels.

I avoided this film for not strong reasons. Maybe the title. But the title is very important once you see the film. Plus, could it REALLY be as great as it was being touted? Well. Yes it is.

As many reviewers have said, there isn't a wasted moment in this film. It's sleek and quick in it's over 2 hour length. You have no idea of time as you are a fly on the wall with both these families.

Humor - brilliant. Twists and turns - perfection. Surprises - what do you think?

Cinematography is another character in the film. A very necessary one. Again, done to utter perfection.

This film was a great way to start the day! Now I can think of it all weekend while cleaning the house.","Apr 9, 2022"
10,Awesome,"Great movie, and for those that think this isn't a masterpiece, well, they don't know movies or maybe it's the subtitles. I think it was a brilliant movie that leaves you thinking about it for hours afterwords. Get past the subtitles and fall into a new world...","Mar 27, 2021"

10,Brilliant,"Another rewatch, and this time it's another Bong Joon-Ho incredible work. The first half was funny and entertaining due to the witty ways that the main family climbed their ways into making a living. This wouldn't work well without the brilliant acting from the cast as well as the clever script.

The second half was where the themes became apparently clear. The intestines scenes showed the struggles and determinations that the lower class had in order to climb up the society. Through the conversations, we had a maddening look at the differences between the two social classes, and how fed up one can feel. The use of symbolism was brilliant and subtle, which made the script even more masterful.

Overall, arguably Bong Joon-Ho's best work. 9.5/10.","Jul 19, 2021"
10,A Film With Real Characters And Human Interest,"After hearing everyone go on about this film for almost a year I finally caught it last night and was blown away by the craft. Parasite was clearly made by someone who loves cinema and puts a lot of thought into shaping characters and plot. The first half of this film is as close to perfection as anything I've ever seen.

We are introduced to the very human, relatable Kim family, forced to hustle due to their extremely limited means. The steal wifi and fold pizza boxes for money. And then they get a foot in the door to gain various types of employment from a wealthy family who need an English tutor. I won't spoil the plot any more than that, but this film buzzes along from one exciting and interesting event to the next in a way that's logical, humurous, compelling and occasionally dark.

The first hour or so is the set up, and the second half of the film is a murky thriller that borders on horror. Some people find fault with the second half of the film and I will say it has some very minor issues with shifts in pacing and some slightly abrupt exposition (EDIT: just watched it a second time and the pacing in the second half is fine - I just didn't take it all in well the first time around) but these are minor quibbles and not enough for me to deduct a point. The film had such a likable, warm centre that I simply don't want to take away from it.

In terms of meaning, I saw Parasite as being about the extreme difficulty of upward social mobility. The son of the family is shown climbing stairs to a higher social station, only to descend them again later on in the rain. The Kims stare up at the world from the window of their semi-basement abode and enjoy better surroundings on a higher level later on but seem destined to return whence they came. It also deals very explicitly with the lack of solidarity between members of the working class during conflict.

You get the sense, too, that the movie is saying that being good or bad has little to do with where you land in society. The Kims do bad things but you completely understand why they do them. The rich family they land jobs with, the Parks, actually seem like nice enough people, although they've allowed themselves to become detached, snobby and insulated against the feelings of others.

The Parks don't have to hustle and lie because they're already well-shod and well-fed, and the director makes sure you realise this: that people hustle and scheme at times when they're desperate, not because they're terrible. And that if you're lucky enough to be doing well you can afford not to get your hands dirty (it's implied there is an element of luck in the Park family's success because they are depicted as pretty naive and gullible, and not as wildly talented geniuses - the father is apparently doing well in a good company but on the whole they come across as fairly ordinary or even doltish).

Anyway, I rambled on about this movie but I enjoyed it so much I want to encourage anyone who hasn't seen it to check it out. One final word: the acting, sets and music are all fantastic and the movie is great to look at.","Mar 12, 2021"
10,Great family satire,"I won't get into the details of the movie as I do not want to spoil the fun. The contrast between the wealthy family, the Parks, and the poor one, the Kims is well set. Starting from a seemingly classic story of social class it evolves in a great family drama with a great plot twist. I particularly enjoy the bitter sweet aspect of this story. You are at times rooting for the Kims and at other times for the Parks. I'm glad this movie got the Oscar. It is a refreshing view on society class and its impacts; and a welcome change from the typical, 'always end well"" type of Hollywood movies.","Mar 2, 2021"

10,A must see movie that makes you ponder on the real world,"I can undoubtedly say Parasite was one of the most touching movies I have watched. I was not expecting a foreign language, occurring in a foreign society would affect me so much. Since engaging with another society far from your culture is rather perplexing especially in a movie But, every element of this movie was so well put together together that dragged the audience from the beginning to the end without a blink. The ending was not maybe what viewers anticipated from the beginning, but it wasn't too far out of sight either. The soundtracks were meticulously composed with a purpose for each scene to convey the emotion that the director wants to the audience. Because Parasite has played with all my emotions from happiness to sorrow throughout the film and the soundtracks along with the actors were exceptional in deliberating this story to us. This movie pictures the extreme gap between the classes in a society. The story begins with a family who is struggling to make ends meet by folding pizza boxes and selling them and live in half of the basement in a very poor neighbourhood. Their son is taking over a friend's job to teach English in a very wealthy house. The family one by one find their way into the wealthy family household by working for them, from cook to chauffeur. The movie started as a comedy then shifts to a thriller, drama and eventually a bit horror. The movie is shedding light on the problems of society that is rarely talked about. It has made me realize there are struggles in the society that we don't see. The working poor and underclass are not right in front of us. We are all living in one place, but they are the ones who have to crumple in half a basement with the very poor living condition. This is a society where one family is thrilled to see the rain and the other is seeking shelter because the overflooded rain has ruined their basement. If you want an eye-opening movie that shows you the brutalities of a capitalist world, then this is the movie for you. It makes you wonder of what else is happening in a society that you have no slightest idea? It gives you insights of rarely discussed struggles in societies that doesn't care much about the poor. I don't want to spoil it more than I did already, but I have deeply been thinking about the effect of society on people. What one might do to reach the top? How much this gap between classes put pressure on lower classes? This movie has brilliantly pictured the answer to these questions. I myself have watched this a few times and with a group of people, it is a great movie for conversations! I believe Parasite unquestionably deserved the four Oscars it received including the best picture for the first time ever for a foreign movie.","Feb 14, 2021"

10,A masterpiece,"""Snowpiercer"" was very good, ""Parasite"" is even better! Bong Joon-ho delivers a clever analysis of the class society in which we live today in his ingenious thriller, which is horror film, comedy and drama at the same time. A poor family invades the home of a rich family and starts working for them. But who are the real parasites? The society of the rich is characterized by friendliness and serenity - but it's precisely this habitus that you first have to be able to afford. And it shouldn't fool us about the balance of economic power. We don't see good or bad individuals in ""Parasite"", rather Bong Joon-ho has created character masks for his characters in order to expose the class relations. Moreover, ""Parasite"" is a thrilling and aesthetically brilliant movie, in which there isn't a single wrong picture.","Nov 2, 2019"

10,Movie of the year - Everything is pure imposture,"Everything is pure imposture Movie of the year: a wonderful cinematographic surprise, wellplayed, well done! Everything is pure imposture that seems to be the only way for the protagonist family, father, mother, son and daughter, to get a job at all and to reach the state of happiness. At one point, the disillusioning sentence is heard from the father: ""500 university graduates apply for a position as a night watchman."" Everything could be so beautiful if the poor family's greed wasn't so great and their recklessness. They soon discover that the old housekeeper whom they had pushed out of their position has a dangerous secret that could endanger their new positions. This triggers a chain of surreal, mad and wonderful situations that lead to the poor family losing everything and more. But against the background of the madness of the rich family and their airs, all the sins of the poor family were finally excusable. It fills me with sadness that the poor, without rights always remain the poor and without rights, and with every attempt to change their fate they just slide deeper into their Schlamassel.","Nov 22, 2020"
10,An International masterpiece,"Why is this movie a masterpiece? Why did it become the first non-English-language Oscar-winning film? Why is it ideologically universal and international? The poor slaves of North Korea evoke sympathy. The poor of South Korea at first - too. Until impunity and the prosperity that fell on their heads made them pigs, monsters, parasites that can't stop from greed. But what spoils their ""raspberry""? A sudden spark of sympathy that had been awakened in the new housekeeper's heart for the old, drenched, ill, and undeservedly turned out of the house and work - for the ex-housekeeper who had come to feed her husband. He lives in complete isolation, in prison-like the North Koreans, but, temporarily gaining the upper hand, they begin to mock the exposed family and, at the same time, Kim Jong-Un. Or the moment when the driver (for some reason?) he kills his master and the young entrepreneur just before he dies suddenly says: ""I recognized you!» (that's why!). North and South Koreans - both rich and poor-suddenly become so similar! What's it? National Korean mentality? Unlikely. So you think: the USSR and modern Russia, slave-owning America and modern superpower, Nazi Germany and the modern locomotive of the European Union-are they not mirror images? In the sense that on the other side of the mirror glass - they are the same, simply inverted. Money didn't make rich people happy. They become indifferent and blind to someone else's misfortune, but turn into such blind suckers that it is easy to trick them around your finger. Family values (""banana"" for a hungry husband) are beautiful, but their absolutization makes people sectarian, shackles them with a series of crimes in the yoke of circular bail. In the age of technology, miracles happen when you suspect that all the teachers (a couple of phrases in English and OK), doctors (who put on a white coat becomes the doctor), lawyers (observe the formalities and enjoy yourself) + photoshop, arrogance and skill - all these professionals are just as fake as, for example, a housewife (I don't know what it is - I'll cook it according to the instructions on the label), not to mention art therapists (surf the Internet and that'll do), coaches, psychologists and other shamans. Everyone plays, lies, pretends to believe, or wants to believe, but everyone follows the rules of the game. Until something happens that violates these rules: the spark of empathy I was talking about; an ancient stone (""it's so metaphorical!"") that is supposed to bring material well-being, and then slips out of your hands at the most inopportune moment and breaks the conspiracy, and that the hero can't tear away from himself. The smell of a basement that you can't get rid of. The flood is a natural disaster that you expect, but it always comes unexpectedly. And the film turned out to be light. It talks about values that people neglect, but which nevertheless remind them of themselves in symbols: nature (flood), ancient traditions (stone), belonging to one's social class (smell), family relations (the banana, playing Indians), sympathy (helping a person who got wet in the rain). A sure sign of a real work of art is motivation, non-randomness of EVERY DETAIL, which creates a harmonious ambivalence of art.","Apr 24, 2020"
10,Outstanding movie,All actors and director both done great work i can't explain,"Dec 10, 2020"
10,"You will see the consequences of social inequity shot in such a interestingly relatable manner, it will be hard to dislike it","Filmmaker Bong Joon Ho once again surprised us with another masterpiece named Parasite. Where powerful social satire meets tragedy. The director did a great job portraying South Korea's current views on society exposing the underprivileged slums of most modern cities and it's citizens living in completely different worlds despite staying in close proximity. You are likely to find it relatable as the themes of this story are not just localized to Korea, but all over the world. Having its fair share of global capitalism and universal materialism, Meritocracy being the biggest trope of this movie.

Now, the best way to enjoy this film is to cluelessly get into it, its charm is to watch it progress and unfold in many satisfying, unexpected ways.

You can definitely see a unique directorial vision as Parasite welcomes the audience into multi-genres and tonal shifts that mix and take its turn after every act. Pure comedy, dark comedy to heavy drama, horror, thriller, mystery, you name it. It is one of the hardest things to pull off but the director converts them smoothly without letting the audience feel indifferent to the transformation. It manages to elicit the full range of responses, making the viewer react with uneasy laughter to unexpected situations that eventually lead to disturbing events full of horror.

Now, who are the real parasites? The poor who attach themselves to the rich or the rich who suck the marrow of the poor?

Satirically, it managed to portray how we may live under the same skies, but have different views regarding life.

-- ""You know what kind of plan never fails? No plan. No plan at all. You know why? Because life cannot be planned.""

Success and fortune are reserved for those who deserve it, those who develop solid plans according to their talents and abilities and who execute those plans through hard work and determination. Anyone can rise to the top, but for those who cannot escape their sad reality will ultimately turn for the worse and thus start to justify their immoral backstabbing, deceit, and callousness for reasoning that can be only explained by growing up poor without support from others.

The characters all have different aspects to them that will be received and viewed differently due to the viewers own biases and world views. This isn't a bad thing as the movies main point is to deliver a provocative social commentary in various metaphors. And the best way to do so is to create morally questionable characters that will resemble at least one familiar person known to you.

,,Greed is inside each one of us, but the question is, how much are you willing to sacrifice for an idea of life in comfort?'' --- All in all, Parasite is a fantastic case of hard-hitting yet entertaining cinema.

And one of the best movies recently made in Korea.","Nov 14, 2023"

This movie has the best example of an amazing midpoint and conveys a theme and deeper meaning better than any other movie I've seen. The first half of the film was captivating enough, but once it reaches it's midpoint I was glued to my seat and my eyes were glued to the screen; this movie is close to perfect; I'm sure it might have some flaws, however, I can't see them since the are so easy to overlook because of the qualities that it would take me hours to list. Just to name a few; the pacing is fantastic, the characters are interesting, the conflict is original, and it has one of the best montages of recent years.

10,Have you watched Parasite yet ?,"Thoroughly entertaining but also really interesting to analyse. This movie contains a variety of genre which makes it really entertaining and gripping. It starts out as a sort of mystery, thriller, comedy heist then goes to be a more dramatic, crime film. The film is an interesting representation of our society and contains a lot of symbols and important details crucial for this movie. Entertaining from beggining to end the film has no boring scenes despite it having not that much action scenes. Most of the scenes of the film remains in the dialogue and it's fascinating characters. Excellent writing in my opinion. A film to re watch.","Aug 28, 2023"
10,Parasite,"Parasite is, without a doubt, the most talked-about movie of 2020. It's also the highest-rated film on Letterboxd. Indeed, no matter the source, I had only heard great things about it and to say that my expectations were high, would be an understatement.

Thankfully though, despite the popularity of Parasite, I had no idea what it was about. I knew, of course, that it was about the divide between the rich and the poor. However, as far as the plot or any significant moments went, I was clueless. As such, I want to start by talking about how unpredictable this film is and how drastically it changes tone when it needs to. While there seems to be significance in every moment and every shot, there were four moments that particularly stood out to me, or should I say four periods. The first, and most obvious one, is the beginning. Those moments where we get to know Kim Ki-taek and his family. Those early moments of happiness despite struggle and despair. A family that, if nothing else, had each other. Those early moments were filled with a sense of longingness and intimacy, simplicity and even to a certain extent, hope. The first tonal shift, and the beginning and what I would consider the second period, comes as Ki-woo, the son of the family, gets a job tutoring the daughter of rich parents. What follows is a period of deceit and urgency. Those previous tones are forgotten as they lay a path for a fast-paced, comedic period that promises a better life, despite the dangers associated. As the family starts to settle into their new roles, and as their lives start to change, the sense of despair turns into one of greed and ruthlessness. While the first and second period were often humorous and light-hearted, the two last ones are the opposite. The second shift in tone and the start of the third period comes as the family learns of a hidden truth inside the house they now inhabit without permission. This is perhaps the most significant shift in tone, as it not only introduces a certain level of violence, but it also blurs the line between good and evil even further. It's also the first time where, despite how Kim Ki-taek and his family hope to see themselves, they have become what they once despised. They have turned from those looked down upon, to those who look others down. With this change in roles and tone, the film increases in tension and leaves a sense of uncertainty in the air. A sense that won't go away until the fourth, and final, period. Indeed, the third, and arguably final shift in tone, comes as the family find their own home destroyed by a downpour of rain. It is after these events that Kim Ki-taek and Ki-woo, especially, turn into different people. They find themselves looking back at who they once were before they got a taste of 'the better' life. Attitudes change back to what they once were, and the actions fuelled by these attitudes are ones of despair and hate, hopelessness and spite.

Now, as I mentioned, it could be argued that there is one final shift in tone at the very end. And indeed, it might be the most interesting one. Every action prior to this point was fuelled by self-interest and a sense of right to something, that others possess. However, as Ki-woo tries to find stability in his and his family's life, the actions, while still driven by self-interest, do not attempt to benefit from others. It is perhaps the most significant change in the entire film, which mind you is full of changes in the first place. It's a change that pits all the preconceived ideas against one another. No longer do the poor feel unjustly abandoned and the sense of hope that was apparent in the beginning returns. Despite everything that has happened, it's that hope that shines the brightest and leads to a promise of a better life. The reason why I feel that those final moments are so significant is that the whole movie, prior, has spent its time creating a chasm between those well-off and those not. However, as it progresses, and ultimately reaches its conclusion, that chasm has diminished and blurred into one that can barely be seen. And indeed, by the final shot, it seems to have disappeared completely.

While the divide between income classes is central to Parasite, there is an endless number of other such divides. Another central theme, and one that plays throughout, is the goodness of people. At no point is there any clear indication about who is good and who is bad. And interestingly, despite their claim to be bad and unkind people, it's Kim Ki-taek's family who is, at first, the group that you root for. However, as the story moves forward, and the lure of money turns into greed, it becomes clear that it might indeed be the rich family that we should be rooting for. And by the time the film ends, it's impossible to define what is good and bad, anymore. No one, despite their background and wealth, is just good or just bad. But alas, as much as I would like to delve deeper and deeper into all the various examinations of human nature, there are so many to dissect that it would take me hours upon hours and days upon days to do so. Even on a first watch, there seemed to be so many layers to explore and unpack that, quite frankly, I'm a little overwhelmed. As such, it's no wonder Parasite is so incredibly highly regarded. It's not the type of film that many will consider their favourite, but there is no doubt about its excellence and perfection.

Parasite is, without a doubt, one of the most special movie experiences I have ever had. It's a masterclass in filmmaking, but it's also so much more. Rarely can any film so honestly examine and depict human nature, let alone make it into a film that, while often heavy, is enjoyable. While it will never be something that I will consider a favourite, it more than deserves the praise it has garnered, and quite frankly, I can't wait to watch it again to see just how much I missed the first time.","Jan 5, 2021"
10,"Bong Joon-ho's ""Parasite"" is a thought-provoking masterpiece on class inequality and survival","Bong Joon-ho's ""Parasite"" is a striking social commentary that delves into the dark side of class inequality, greed, and the illusion of upward mobility. The film follows a poor family's attempts to infiltrate the lives of a wealthy family, leading to a series of unexpected events. The cinematography, direction, and acting are all exceptional, and the film's message is conveyed in a manner that is both compelling and thought-provoking.

The film's exploration of the haves and have-nots is executed brilliantly, with the script being both engaging and unpredictable. The cast, particularly the actors who play the poor family, gives authentic performances, and the dynamic between the characters is gripping.

Bong Joon-ho's direction is masterful, and the film's pacing is on point. The use of sound and lighting adds to the film's eerie atmosphere, and the symbolism and metaphors throughout the film are well thought out and executed.

""Parasite"" is a work of art that raises questions about society's structure and the lengths individuals will go to in order to survive. It is a film that is both haunting and unforgettable, leaving a lasting impression on the viewer.","Mar 26, 2023"
10,Liked everything about this movie.,"One of the best hollywood movies ever watched so far. Be it the Casts, Acting, Cinematography, Plot, Locations all were excellent. I will rate this movie 10/10. This is was such a movie which will remembered lifetime, This movie is filled with amazing actors who truly make the film. The Protagonist hailing from a poor background gives a legendary performance in this film and is absolutely awestruck. The casting for this movie is truly perfect, and the actors do not disappoint.

One of the best things about this movie is that it's so relatable and showing the contrast of poor and rich which the director has chosen the location/sets perfectly . Regardless of your embarrassing situation, the actors has probably gotten into something worse.

Overall, this is a great movie with a mix of a emotions in the end . If you're looking for a unique movie with surprise twists and turns, this is undoubtedly the movie for you.","Apr 9, 2023"
10,Amazing,"You forget it's not in English after the first few minutes; that's how gripping it is. What a wild story and innovative idea. The movie screams our society's obsession/dependence with money and WiFi. Social commentary aside, still quite amazing.","Jan 9, 2021"

10,Thoroughly entertaining.,"I am not in Korean movies or music, so I watched this movie only because it won the Oscar.

I was wowed by the concept, gripping narrative, and character development. The way the director showcased the class difference was unique and unlike anything I have seen before (I have watched limited movies, so I could be ignorant).

All in all, I am gonna watch it again someday.","Sep 26, 2020"

10,Best picture indeed,"Parasite has just earned the title of the first foreign film to win best picture and it Very much deserves it, as Parasite is one of the closest things to a flawless masterpiece I've ever seen. From the great cast, the beautiful cinematography, the genius script, every aspect of Parasite is good. This is undoubtably director Bong Joon Ho's masterpiece and some of the best work of any director. It's story will grip you with is realistic characters and masterful twists, and the intelligence with which it highlights issues of today's society will haunt your mind for weeks to come.","Sep 9, 2020"
10,Absolutely Amazing!,This movie is one of the most unique I have seen. The ending is definitely one you will remember. The combination of the whole film and the ending leaves you on thoughts and gives a feeling you may have never experienced. I highly recommend this movie. Absolute masterpiece!,"Sep 13, 2020"
10,Parasite ( the mindblowing movie of 2019),"First of all, my friend recommended me that movie so I saw the movie first I thought the movie will be boring but after sometime I can't get my eyes out becaus it was suspicious and funny movie. The narrator and the actors were excellent and the ending is quit good. Overall I really enjoy the movie😇","Sep 3, 2020"
10,The film that gave Bong Joon-ho the respect he deserves!,"As a movie fanatic, I always have a thirst to find that one movie that makes me say ""Oh, so that just happened. I can't believe it went down like that. BUT I LIKED IT!"" And that's exactly how this movie made me feel. There are a few great movies that don't get the recognition they deserve but I'm glad that this one did. Not only is it a brilliant but MOST IMPORTANTLY a UNIQUE story, which I feel that nowadays is pretty hard to find a movie with these two important concepts. Director Bong Joon-ho not only created a brilliant story, but also did an amazing work flushing out every single character in this film. I had the privilege of going in completely blind, in other words not knowing a single thing about this movie when I saw it for the first time. I didn't know what the film was was about, ( which the trailer did a good job of not spoiling ) I didn't know who the director was ( which I later found out that it was the same director who made 'The Host' and 'Snowpiercer', which are movies that I personally enjoyed watching ) I didn't know any of the actors ( which I think that they did an amazing job with their acting in this film, but I did know who the actor Kang-Ho Song was, seeing him in many other well known movies such as 'The Host' and 'The Drug KIng' ). I think that Bong Joon-ho did an amazing work with the cinematography and visual storytelling in this film. I cannot put every single emotion that this movie made me feel into words. I am happy that this movie did well at the box office, I'm also happy that it has become a universal classic and deserves every praise it gets!

GO WATCH IT IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN IT. IT'S A MUST WATCH!","Sep 3, 2020"
10,A true masterpiece,"I saw this film in an empty cinema with my girlfriend around a month ago now and i haven't been able to stop thinking about it since. If you can, see this film without having any idea about what to expect and i guarantee you'll have a more enjoyable viewing experience. The twists and turns throughout are done crazily well and almost everything that happens within the film comes as a surprise to the viewer. Easily the best film of the last 2 years for me and should be talked about in cinematic history for many a year to come.","Aug 31, 2020"
10,Very realistic movie,"The cinematography of this film is fantastic, but the story is the special ingredient here.","Nov 20, 2020"
10,"Breathtaking, Extraordinary and UNIQUE!!","A movie demonstrating different classes in society, accompanied with great acting, an original plot and beautiful cinematography, if you want a movie that you can find new things and hidden meanings everytime you rewatch, Parasite is THE movie you want, certainly one of the best movies of last decade and completely deserved all single awards it won.","Mar 5, 2022"
10,"A Perfect Script, Perfect Direction, a Perfect Film","I'll be honest, when I first watched Parasite, it was after the Academy Awards and the hype had been around for a while. On first watch, my first watch for me it seemed like an okay movie that seemed messy. On second watch, I thought it was a good movie that had a mediocre script. And on third watch, I thought that it was a really good movie with a decent story. But on fourth watch, I finally understood the hype. Parasite is not only my favorite movie of all time, but I would bet that it is practically flawless. I think it should be up there with the top 10 films of all time. There's the obvious proof of Parasite's excellence with the Oscars for Best Original Screenplay, Best International Feature, Best Director, and Best Picture. But I promise this film is much more than a typical Oscar film. It is complex and fun movie that has one of the best screenplays ever written and I'd argue the best direction of any film I've ever seen. Granted, I haven't seen Citizen Kane or The Godfather. If you are someone who appreciates or likes the Oscars, it is an absolute must watch. And if you don't care about the Oscars or awards season, I highly recommend it.","Aug 21, 2020"

10,Loved it,"Bong Joon-Ho's epic thriller opened me up to South Korea's expanding film culture.

With clever dialogue, detailed set design and edge of your seat moments like I've never seen before, Parasite very much deserved its 4 Oscars it received, including Best Picture.","Aug 10, 2020"
10,Really a masterpiece,"I want to salute this movie's director... When I watched this movie, I fell in love with movie's director. Don't hesitate to watch this movie","Aug 30, 2020"
10,Incredible,"The narrative of this film is so unique.

The first act may seem slow, but then the narrative develops in a very original and believable way, the script does not just develop a few things, everything has a convincing explanation. The film deals with issues of contempt for different social classes, and since the upper social class is not at all interested in the problems of others, they only live in their bubble while the world falls apart, this is portrayed in a crude and realistic way, by showing different representations of this. The character development is extensive, the acting is good, the editing is good, and the third act is very shocking and unexpected.

It deserves all the awards it won, it is a very good film that is worthwhile and has a lot of quality, with a well-executed original concept it manages to captivate the public's attention all the time.","Apr 13, 2022"

10,Perfect thriller.,There is a lot of comedy and drama in the film but I consider it a thriller and a good one. I learned a lot of stuff about the culture and pretty much we are not different. It's always the same situation with slightly different dimensions. This is a cruel world.,"Aug 3, 2020"

And the good news is that the movie actually is fantastic. Maybe Joker was a better film but who is going to give Joker a chance? Better Parasite than 1917!,"Jul 28, 2020"
10,I Believe I Have Found My New Favourite Movie,"Parasite is something special. It seemingly could fit into a multitude of different genres, so there is really no clear answer to what it actually is. I would probably classify it as a thriller myself though. The first hours of the movie does a great job establishing all the characters, making you care for them. The second hour of the movie, is where things go crazy. Never before, have I been more on the edge of my seat watching a movie. The tension is absolutely incredible, my heart must have been going at 150 BPM at one point. Do yourself a favour, and go watch this brilliant movie.","Feb 21, 2022"

10,Not as bad as I was expecting,"I saw parasite just after it's Oscar sweep. But was still unsure, you see the thing is I was rooting for 1917 to sweep and was wondering what this parasite film actually was. I watched the trailer and didn't quiet get it. But I decided to give it a go anyway. After sitting through its 2h 8m runtime I couldn't disguise my satisfaction. The movie was one of the best I'd seen from recent years. I will say don't let the subtitles put you off experiencing this masterpiece.

The twist came completely out of the blue but did not in any way feel cheap or unearned. In fact the felt extremely consistent with the story whilst still changing the plots destination

As for the oscars do I feel that parasite should have seeped? No. Sure I think that best picture, best foreign language film and production design (parasite actually didn't win production design but I think it should have) However I think Sam mendes should have one Director, rian Johnson should have won original screenplay but I'm not so mad anymore.

Overall watch parasite and prepare to be amazed","Aug 18, 2020"
10,Fantastic!,"I don't even know what to say about this movie. Just go watch it. I watched it more than a month ago and I still think about it everyday.

It has so many layers. This movie really impressed me, it was a completely different experience of what I was waiting for and I absolutely love that. It catched me off guard.

It's such a fantastic social commentary.","Oct 20, 2019"
10,this movie and Titanic tells how cruel our world is,"I just watched Titanic and this and I saw in both movies how people who has that stupid paper ,WHICH IS CALLED MONEY, look at people who doesn't and it's disgusting. I hated it when in Titanic they put the rich people on the boats and lock the poor people deep down in the ship. we are all humans and should be respecting each others soul as prophet Muhammad said ""All mankind is from Adam and Eve, an Arab has no superiority over a non-Arab nor a non-Arab has any superiority over an Arab; also a white has no superiority over black nor a black has any superiority over white except by piety and good action.""","Jul 26, 2020"

10,One of the best of the decade,"One of those movies you can't look away from. I have watched it three times and it was equally enjoyable each time.

The movie starts on some brilliant note showing how struggling life some people live with. But suddenly thier life changes time by time and all family members got employed. This also shows how their poverty forced them to lie. The movie on some point feels as real world situation. Overall it shows how and what problems a family have to went through for their family and forces them to do wrong things. Must watch !,"Jun 21, 2020"

10,I am so glad this movie succeed so much,It should have got more Oscars if you ask me. What's not to like? This movie has everything. It's very rare to find a film like that.

I've been watching a lot of Asian films lately for a change I was surprised of how good some of them are. American movies are going down sooner or later.,"Jul 22, 2020"
10,All Time Favorite,"As the title suggests, Parasite is my all time favorite film. Bong's original screenplay is one of the freshest and most original ideas I've ever seen/heard of. The idea of a poor family leeching off of a rich family by pretending to be qualified is brilliant. There truly has not been any other film like parasite and I think it should be appreciated as such. The characters and dialogue throughout the film strike as very realistic which is why everything that happens during the flick strikes the viewers very hard. The ending left me in a very depressed state and changed my view of the world a bit. It helped me realize of privilege and how the world just isn't that great. Upon thinking about the film later, I also wondered what the movie would've been like in the Kims' perspective. I believe this movie is one of the greatest ever made, and is an instant classic","Aug 5, 2020"
10,Fantastic,"Parasite is special in that it is able to achieve what other movies about metaphors can't, it's entertaining and highly enthralling. The movie doesn't have a dull moment. If you struggle to buy into the metaphor about meritocracy, you will still be highly entertained by a dark and very often sinister movie.","Jun 28, 2020"

10,***Film of the century!!!***,"This is a remarkable film of the century which depicts many social issues we confront everyday such as class system, racism, global warming, gap between the rich and the poor and discrimination against poverty along many other social issues that we face everyday. Director Bong Joon-Ho has dealt with various topics as such in his previous films yet this film has the best story telling and cinematography as seen. This film deserves global attention not just for film lovers but for all in which we can all relate one way or another to criticise what needs attention and correction in our society. Recommend to all genre of movie lovers as this has hints of humour, comedy, action as well as drama.","Jun 1, 2020"
10,Amazing,Best movie I've ever seen. The story is dark but the meanings are deep. The most of the scene was memorable.,"May 26, 2020"
10,Just a masterpiece,"This thriller from South Korea shocked the world in 2020 when it became the first non-English language film to win the Oscar for Best Picture. The plot of the film is also one where you wouldn't necessarily think it would appeal to the Academy: a poor family of four living in the underground struggles to survive. When the son gets the opportunity to work for a very wealthy family, their situation suddenly turns around. As a result, events turn upside down.

Contrary to other mainstream films, in which the main - supporting scheme is usually clearly followed through, in Parasite the entire cast shines at the same high level. All of them act in absolute top form and give their so different characters that certain something. If you had to pick a stand out, it would be Kim Ki-taek as the father of the poor family. His performance is subtle and funny for long stretches, but once he comes out of his shell, he impresses with a lot of wisdom and unpredictability. But the real hero of the film is director Bong Joon Ho. Known in his home country for years as a borderline brilliant filmmaker, he has given Parasite an aura that few could replicate. Not only is the ensemble of actors spot-on, but everything else, from the stirring music to the beautiful set designs and well-chosen dialogue, he has done everything right with this film.

Parasite's success should never have come as a big surprise. Bong Joon Ho's masterpiece is one of the most complete films of recent years. Especially the fact that the film initially resembles a comedy and only then lives up to its actual genre of thriller is a unique approach. In parallel, there is also the influence of other genres, such as drama, mystery and even some action. It remains to mention the social criticism that Parasite tries to communicate over its entire 134 minutes. The class differences in South Korea are portrayed very well. Sometimes discreetly, but mostly transparently and very clearly. This is especially thought-provoking when you watch the film repeatedly and become more aware of this fact. Wonderfully acted, grandiose direction and many genres colliding - Parasite is perfect and rightly the best film of 2020!","Jan 6, 2021"

10,Up There with the Best,"For me, one of the greatest cinematic experiences I have ever indulged in. It's meticulous in its design, effective in its direction, and enticing in its writing.

The struggling Kim family sees an opportunity when the son starts working for the wealthy Park family. Soon, all of them find a way to work within the same household and start living a parasitic life.

Their is no arguing against the film's success and quality. A starling watch which incorporates societal divide through an imbalanced class system and utilising primitive methods to target the lack of understanding within humankind, highlighted in the consequences of rich and poor mixing. Ki-woo, a key figure of poverty in the film is seen to work as a tutor at The Parks' home, Joon Ho implemented this into his production because unfortunately it is the only way in which families from two extreme ends of the class spectrum in modern-day South Korea can cross their paths convincingly in their story arc. For non-Korean speakers, the film is possibly even more exciting, its vibrant, fast tone compliments the increasingly intimate storyline and allows the unfolding of the subplot to be extra special. Setting is used by director Bong Joon Ho to further emphasise the contrasting lifestyles on-screen; A small, open street-terrace on a bustling corner of the town centre contrasts greatly to a large, gated mansion, a home built and designed from scratch solely for the film's purpose.

Every detail of the blockbuster is well-received by its audience, mesmerised by every characters every move, captivated in what will happen next. Ultimately, 'Parasite' is a 'be careful what you wish for' message. The title itself referenced an infectious agent, which some may suggest refers to the Kim family swarming The Park's for work and benefits, though is it actually alluding to the diseased poor in civilisation who are made to suffer from the capitalistic greed denying them of jobs, education and healthcare.

The picture is an illustrated masterpiece, carefully pioneered to demonstrate serious philosophical subjects in a fantastical manner to convey relevant and important philosophies.","Jul 15, 2022"
10,Super good story,"Love this story, characters, humor. Everything in this movie is perfect. There's no question tags, doubts. When you are thinking that everything what could happen just happened something new appears.","May 5, 2020"
10,It's the most brilliant film I've ever seen.,"One of my favorite films is ""Parasite"". Despite the fact the film's plot reflects social inequality, it is presented straightforwardly and simply. Throughout the story, the film asks us to ask questions in our heads. More than that, it is excellent in terms of production. Every point of view, color grading, and sound effects are meaningful and exciting, drawing the audience even deeper into the film. Overall, it's still a fantastic film with a great script. To make it more understandable, the film concerns heavy topics like class and social inequality. The audience can answer the question at the end of the story that the villain of the story is not poor or the rich, but social inequality, which causes people to be villains.","Mar 9, 2021"

10,Gisaengchung,"One of the most powerful things about this film is that at first sight, it seems that the evil of the poor is naked, while the rich family is a little innocent. But take a closer look and find that the hypocrisy and indifference of the rich without any flaws is the stone that lies on their family. The family is unaware of a poor man who has lived in his basement for several years, and the last scene is hopeless for the poor, which is the reality of society.","Apr 14, 2020"
10,Superb,"Aside from the film's encapsulating theme of socio-economic disparity, Bong Joon-ho achieves a Hitchcock-like presence that will have you at the edge of your seat. Suspense, comedy, and drama fall short in describing the intersectional and multimodal genre of this on-screen Román a clef. Setting the tone for the 2020's, Parasite is internationally relatable, aesthetically pleasing, and witty - ""we all have a crazy family"" comes to life as more than just a phrase in this two-hour phenomenon of the decade.","Apr 9, 2020"
10,Excellent,"Parasite is about a wealthy Korean family in a modern-day Downton Abbey upstairs-downstairs situation, one far more unstable than the patrician caste realises. The film could perhaps be a bit more lean and mean, and deliver its jeopardy and payoff with more despatch. But it is an enjoyable, elegant, scabrous movie about a mix of servitude and trickery that is an interesting theme in Korean cinema.","Apr 8, 2020"
10,I'll never get over this.,"I went to see Parasite in the cinemas... TWICE. This film is brilliant. It's funny in the most witty yet realistic way possible. It's deeply tragic. It's terrifying when you least expect it. Parasite leads you to believe that it's one thing, and suddenly transforms into another. It's a complete masterpiece. The tiny details you will find upon a second viewing or the tiniest bit of research will blow you away. The message behind it is clear but not too obvious. A repeat viewing is perhaps even more satisfying than the first, knowing what's THERE before it is revealed is just... a feeling I can't explain. It's a must watch. Not to be missed.","Apr 6, 2020"
10,Incredible details and really unexpected twist,"I watched this film couple of months ago, so I'm not writing this review with a completely clear memory of everything that I loved about this movie. All I can say is that at least a week after watching it, I was still googling aaaaall the hidden meanings in certain scenes, all the interviews with the director, why they did some scenes in certain ways etc. This is how starstruck I was. Once I learned about all the layers, I could only conclude that this movie is a masterpiece! I had a class called ""Visual culture"" at my University and this movie would be perfect for the analysis of its visual language. And they show all the different relationships between rich and poor, happy and sad, right and wrong, in suuuuch a subtle way!! I really feel like people should write essays about this film.","Apr 10, 2020"
10,This Movie is Not Overrated,"This movie deserves every bit of attention it has got. Parasite is a surreal experience of luxury, scheming, and deception. I can not wait to see what Bong Joon-Ho has for us next.","Apr 15, 2020"

At the beginning, I thought about giving a 9 because as many other here think it was out of reality to be hired by same family in a modern world where everyone is checked out before to get into a new job, but in this case I think there could be a probability that this family was more focused on recommendations and this could possibly happen! .

There is a reality that is divorced from reality,

How can the gap between classes be so easily broken,

In the end it is nothing but a joy for the poor.

Compared to some movie declarations,

Don't care about other people's prejudice against you,

Live yourself

This movie is much more real,

Don't give you hope,

To expose you all this tragedy naked!

Behind the seemingly absurd, it is nothing more than thinking about money and humanity!","Mar 23, 2020"

10,parasite,"I've been thinking, how do you avoid tragedy? It's better if they don't open the door, or go to the police, than if they do. Because to avoid the real owner of the house to get things must be ""shady"".

But then again, maybe it was in the moment of alcohol-induced happiness that I really thought I was rich and had a kind heart that shouldn't belong to me.","May 16, 2020"
10,A thoroughly deserving Best Picture winner!,"Captivating, intelligent, funny, unique... at times Parasite feels like an opera with its majestic score and visuals.

One of the greatest things about Parasite is its sharp plot. The way that the Kim family plot their scheme and enact their plan is brilliantly devised, and shot in the most extraordinary way. I really liked that the plot didn't bog itself down in the morality of their actions. There was no dithering about from the family and no pause for a discussion of whether what they were doing was right (which I feel an American film would have bogged itself down in). Bong Joon-ho trusted us as an audience to immerse ourselves in the world of the Kim's and just roll with what they doing.

The themes of Parasite were also very layered, some more subtle and complex than others, but all intricately connected and well thought out. The messaging throughout the film was so rich that it remained constantly engaging.

From the little I knew about this film going in I was expecting a dark thriller, so the comedy took me completely by surprise. Choi Yeon-gyo stole the show for me with her comedic scenes standing out the most, and she was perhaps unlucky not to get greater Academy recognition.

I can't sing Bong Joon-ho's praises enough for his direction on Parasite, creating such an eerie atmosphere while also nailing the black comedy. The minimalist design of the house, the bleak colours and tones, all holding their own meanings, really emphasised the messaging of the film and cultivated a constant atmosphere of unease, at times descending into full on horror.

After a second viewing/dissection I'm sure I will have more to say, but for now I will simply say that Parasite is a must watch. Intriguing from the get go and spot on with its dark humour, Parasite is sure to pave the way for a greater visibility of eastern cinema in the west.","Mar 13, 2020"
10,The 'perfect' film.,"This is essentially the perfect film as it does everything - storytelling, visuals, sound, editing, acting etc. - to perfection.

""Parasite"" belongs in the discussion of the greatest films of all-time in my opinion and everyone who appreciates a good film should certainly watch this one.

10,Things completely moves in unexpected territory,"I can't believe people have rated it 6/10. Just how? Not trying to point out fingers but it feels like most people are frustrated that a foreign movie won the Oscar and they wanted their favorite to win. Anyways everyone deserves to have their opinion. I watched movie yesterday and gosh it was more than Perfect. Most of the time I regret watching a movie coz it's too predictable for me. This one blew my mind. I was literally worried about something might happen or other thing not to happen and the story completely flips to unimaginable plot. Also the details in the movie that the director has gone through. Marvelous. For me, I'll put this movie alongside Shawshank Redemption.","Mar 4, 2020"
10,"No one is ""evil"". Then how come the bad things happen?","No one is ""evil"". Then how come the bad things happen?

This cinema does not answer, but masterfully poses all the questions that should be asked. Interestingly enough, just like the characters do in the movie, Bong Joon Ho does not allow the audience a moment to think about the grand theme of the movie until the very end: What went wrong?

It's funny, original, thrilling, and universal. It's a movie to watch thoughtlessly with a can of beer. It's a movie you could sit down and study the metaphors for hours.

Parasite suggests a new paradigm for understanding our society, and most importantly, the people inside it.","Mar 13, 2020"
10,A movie that stays with you hours after watching it.,"In an age of extreme CGI and remakes, Parasite was a treat to watch. The storyline is one of the best I have seen so far. The movie starts of with the viewer thinking it would go one way and then it takes an abrupt turn in the best way possible. I was blown away by the subtle meanings of some of the scenes and dialogues and did not even realize their importance until after a day of finishing the movie. The more time you spend thinking about the screenwriting and direction, the more you start to understand what a masterpiece this is. one hundred percent must watch.","Mar 8, 2020"

It was... at least a movie. As someone who watched Parasite. Watch it if you enjoy movies, as it is one. With a run time of two hours, it is longer than any movie over two hours. The characters ran at multiple points throughout the film, it made me think about running; very scary. If you are a fan of morse code, this movie is for you. With some really representation for morse and braille speakers. I rate this movie.

As someone who had a parasite, I feel like this does my strife justice.

Every shot is piece of art, the editing and visuals are gorgeous and powerful in their symbolism. Plus the score is so so beautiful and emotional, you feel the tension in every moment. The pacing is also fantastic, it leans in slowly, exactly how you want a thriller to do. By the time you've reached the end of it you feel ""how did I get here"" but at the same time it makes total sense how you got there. The desperation portrayed by the actor's performances is also so genuine. Their acting capabilities are so overlooked too when you factor in all the fantastic elements of this movie. It more than meets the mark in every aspect. I would recommend it to almost anyone.","Feb 16, 2020"

10,Parasite film review (2019) by Screams and Whispers,"Synopsis: Kim Ki-woo lives on the edge of poverty with his family. They steal WiFi from their neighbors, work on minimum wage jobs and live in a basement apartment. Kim Ki-woo's life changes when he gets an offer from his friend to work as an English tutor, because the friend was going to study abroad. The friend is infatuated with the girl and wants his friend be around during his absence to avoid others being around his crush. The young man accepts the offer, changes his name to Kevin and starts tutoring Park Da-hye, who quickly falls in love with ""Kevin"". Once among the Parks, Kevin develops a different plan:he want to get his family into the Park family. Will he succeed to get his poor family into the Parks? If yes, will the Kims, the poor family, become as rich and privileged as the Parks? Parasite, by Bong Joon Ho, is the film of the year. It won the Palme d'Or at the 2019 Cannes Film Festival. Apart from its numerous accolades, Parasite won 4 awards at the 92nd Academy Awards for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Original Screenplay and Best International Feature film. This is the first non-English language film to win Best Picture Award. It won as the Best Foreign Language Film at the 77th Golden Globe Awards. It won the Best Film Not in the English Language and the Best Original Screenplay awards at the 73rd British Academy Film Awards.

A bell sounds right at the beginning of the film is there to verify if all the speakers of the theater function properly or not. The bell is there to be compared to the plurality of voices a society produces. Like the bell, there are many others symbols in this film that deserve to be studies closely.

The food in the film often symbolizes the same notion of ""up and down"". The noodles, the cheaper food, are made for Kim family, while the beef, the expensive one, is for the Parks. The rain in the film plays the same role as the food. It emphasizes the opposite perceptions that individuals from two different social classes have about the same thing and how that same thing influences them differently. Water symbolizes the reality and the stone symbolizes false hopes. Water always goes down and not up and can damage those who live ""down"", the poor. This was the case when the strong rain came and damage the Kims' house.

Parasite foreshadowing: the scene, where the fumigation happens, the daughter attempts to close the window, but the father tells not to, because it is a ""free extermination"". Everyone starts coughing, except from the father. During another occasion, the daughter says that she fit in well with the Parks, but ironically she is the first to die. When it comes to the father, he is the only one to continue his life in the basement, just like he was the only one, who was not afraid of the smoke. When it comes to the Indian theme, it is a foreshadowing for the fate of the Parks family. Bong Joon-ho doesn't portray the rich as villains neither the poor as victims. The borderline between the bad and the good is opaque: we do not know for which character we should cultivate the most empathy. Deep down, they may all have the same insecurities and worldview with very slight differences...apart from the smell..., because ""they all smell the same"" according to the Parks. Is it because of the subway, or the soap they use, or the basement smell? It is just a metaphor: the smell symbolizes the poor. By the way, during birthday festivities, the father of the Parks family is killed by the father of the Kims family following his disgust towards the smell of their first housekeeper's husband. One of the highly used symbols is the concept of ""up and down"" or ""high and low"" for class representation. Parks' house is located at the highest point of the town. The upper-class family of Parks rarely looks down on the floor. They always look forward or up, which means that their house's employees hide easily under their tables, in the ground-floor or elsewhere if/when they feel that hiding is necessary. The notion of ""parasite"" is recurrent and questions what exactly it means. Who exactly is ""parasite"": the poor or the rich. Are there any parasites? What if everybody are parasites? One of the most important points of this film is the fact that people fight against each other. Even those, who are down, fight mercilessly for keeping their place in the Parks's house even if it means living in the basement. They lack a lot of solidarity.

Parks' son has an obsession with native Americans. For his birthday, the native american theme is highly used. It represents a surprise: just like the Kims discover that there is a family living rights in the basement of the Parks's house, the Europeans had discovered that there were native Americans living in the newly discovered continent. In both cases the result was the war and/or the fight. Moreover, during the festivities, Kim Ki-woo checks if the other family's father is in the basement taking the stone, which was given to him by his friend as a symbol of success, symbolizing the hope for a better future, with him. The stone is only used to smash someone's head and never brings success. The closing scene shows Kim Ki-woo. In his letter to his father, Kim Ki-woo says that he will work until he could afford to buy the mansion and adds:""All you'll need to do is to walk up the stairs"". These expressions summarizes the myth of social mobility and supports social determinism.","Feb 12, 2020"

10,Parasite looks Totally Different Lives .,"Parasite looks at the totally different lives of kim and Park families and incidents that change their lives totally. Kim lives with his family with limited facilities where they search for wifi all around the house in opening scene.Park family lives a luxurious life with high paid workers all around them for everything. The best thing is how the director potrays the class division and the relation between families of different extend. Starting as a usual story of struggling family, Parasite navigates through relatable dark humour and ends in emotional note.Conversations between the park couple too show their attitude towards the kim family. Director uses rain to show the difference in situations between the families.Rain is shown as beautiful view of nature in Park's house (nice frames too in park family scenes) and as destructive devil in Kim's house. Director aptly uses objects to connect the story.For instance, After an incident, young kim throws a rock that his friend gifts to bring prosperity to the family.That scene shows the kind of superstitious beliefs still existing within us.Look out for the final Kim father-son conversation scene. Technically,bgm enhances the dark satire aspect and conveys the emotion towards the end.Cuts made sure that viewer isn't detached from the progression of the movie at any point once the plot gets interesting. All just performed excellently except Mrs.Park.Her emotions were a bit over-done . I can't justify the final twist where Mr.Kim kills Mr.Park without clear justification and that sums up the only major drawback after watching the movie. Parasite sums up to be the resultant of the script duo's work in the thin plot and some smart execution that makes sure that viewer forgets to think about the wafer thin plot","Apr 24, 2020"

Such a great movie that will perdure a long time.","Apr 11, 2020"

10,Academy gracefully anoints the rightful King...,"I always respected Academy for their independence and the best professional group of critics in cinematography in the world. They didn't hesitate to award Parasite with 4 Oscars in the most important categories.

I watched Parasite over and over again since Cannes award. The progression of the film storyline is amazing as every episode links each other seamlessly but with more deeper tensions.

The intermission was when Mr. Park's family was away for camping. Director Bong probably wanted to provide the audiance a moment to enjoy, relax but with the thunderstorm the fatal second half deploys.

This movie embraces all genre (I would call it neo-genre by Bong) and detailed beauty of the social diversity unfold to its extream.

I have a habit of reading reviews before choosing films and especially I read most of the reviews just before the Oscars announcement. Most of the IMDB members left 8-10 (mostly 10) but after the awards, I can see unexplainable reviews 1 or 2 with non-sense. I know it's out of jealousy and lack of understanding for the Korean films. Hope you watch Parasite again and rethink...","Feb 10, 2020"
10,a must watch movie,"The storyline, cinematography, is very very delight","Feb 10, 2020"
10,Best. Film. Of. The. Decade,"I have seen many films this decade, especially in 2019. However, though many have slipped to the back of my mind, Parasite is the movie title on the edge of my tongue when asked 'what movie do you recommend?' and will be until the next movie blows me away like Parasite did (this may be a while). I watched this movie a while ago but decided to voice my opinion after last lights Oscar success. Very rarely do I explain so little about a movie and just explain to the person 'just watch the movie' yet until you watch it, you won't undertsand why. True Masterpiece.","Feb 10, 2020"
10,Best I have ever seen,"In more years than I want to think about, I never would rate a movie a 10. However, this was impressive. From dark comedy, to violence, to reading everything (which is difficult because I'm not much of a reader) to dissecting each character, it blew my mind. I kept thinking about it days on end. I kept wondering what details I missed that I wanted to find again. This movie is for the creative mind. It isn't for those who just see black and white. From production to writing to music to directing, it was an incredible movie. I'm looking forward to waiting a year or so, so I can relive that magic again.","Mar 17, 2020"
10,One of the best film's I have seen in my life.,"Full Star ratings would seem off had this movie not been such a well written roller coaster of events, this movie has moments that are as thrilling and terrifying as S.

10,Best movie of 2019,Easily the best film of 2019. Potential winner of best movie at the Oscars!,"Feb 4, 2020"
10,"When the lights come on, they crawl away quickly!","After watching some good films in 2019, there were only a few that really blew me away. I'm a big ""Avengers - Endgame"" fan, but ""The Irishman"" and especially ""The Lighthouse"" really touched me. And now we have ""Parasite"" by Bong Joon-ho, the South Korean director of ""The Host"" and ""Snowpiercer"". ""Parasite"" was the first South Korean film to win the golden palm at the Cannes Film Festival and garnered tons of good reviews. Recently it also won four Academys, amogst other things of course ""Best Picture"". Logically, I was interested.

The Kim family lives on a subsistence level and takes every opportunity to improve their situation. How fitting that one day the son receives an offer to help a wealthy family ...

The less you know about ""Parasite"", the better! Nevertheless, I try to rate the film as best as possible without giving anything away.

What is the best way to describe ""parasite""? It´s not easy, because the genre of the film alone is not easy to grasp. The film works here and there as a satire, can surprise with some really funny moments, but also has very metaphorical scenes and then suddenly becomes scary and exciting. And that's all an understatement. ""Parasite"" always surprised me. In a moment you suspect you know what kind of film it is, but then there is the first twist and then the next and I was always surprised. Few films can do that. Joon-ho stages a masterful, socially critical film that works on so many levels. The visual level, for example, is fantastic, ""Parasite"" works with grotesque, but nevertheless appropriate exaggerations, which sometimes are difficult to bear in terms of their message and strength. The name of the film gives a wonderful hint of what to expect.

All actors are fabulous and deserve the greatest recognition, because it is not just the terrific script or the equally fabulous direction that make ""Parasite"" so effective. I especially liked Song Kang-ho as father of the Kims!

Technically, ""Parasite"" offers creative and sometimes breathtaking camera settings. Some spectacular sets were built for the film, such as the Kims' family home. The editing is great and Jeong Jae-il's score was also wonderfully integrated into the visuals; everything just fits here!

Conclusion: You have to see ""Parasite""! It is one of those films that certainly offers something for everyone, but at the same time brings with it so much intelligence and strength that I am amazed and happy at the same time that this South Korean work is so well received by the audience. Without a doubt one of the best films of 2019. A masterpiece, a must-see and in a way also an important film, I think. Terrific!","Feb 17, 2020"
10,A Perfect Film,"Parasite is done exactly how a perfect film should be.

The exposition introduces the characters, their personality and characteristics, their significance, and what they mean in the context of the film in a way that is interesting, well-paced, and fresh. I deeply cared for the well-being and outcome of all these characters, and found myself taking their perspective and cheering on their misadventures. It's a difficult task to get an American audience to connect with an impoverished Korean family, but Bong Joon-ho does it perfectly.

The narrative element is used more to paint a conceptual picture, giving us insight into the ambitions and motives behind the characters. The film takes long winding turns. Viewers who go in expecting an easy watch or a simple lesson are going to get much more than they anticipated.

The film also does well to never put itself in a box. At times it is comedic, often thrilling, very dramatic, and sometimes even horrific. It has highlights in all categories of appeal.

I have nothing bad to say. This is the first film I've watched where I was sure that every moment was done exactly right.","Jul 31, 2020"
10,No way I will not watch this.,"Great, Masterpiece. This movie pictures how human, rich or poor, can do anyhing at any cost to earn what they wanted. But exclusively, this movie shows that even poor people can fool or at this point, ""PARASITE"" onto you, rich or poor. At first-half of the film, I could laugh. But at second-half ('til end), I get the moral lesson of the film.","Feb 2, 2020"
10,A masterpiece that's not from America.,"Parasite is a fantastic film made by the wonderful Bong Joon Ho. Every single frame is beautifully crafted and the story was investing throughout the entire two hour runtime. It is very darkly hilarious, smart, and overall excellent. It also has without a doubt one of the most realistic endings in film history. With a single flaw in sight, Parasite will be perfect for any movie-goer.","Feb 29, 2020"
10,Just.. AMAZING..,"I was surprised that it was so much fun. The entertainment, the artistry, and the social grasp were also the best. It is an oversized home run of a giant stadium that the greatest genius of this era struck.","May 9, 2020"
10,A Must-Watch Foreign Film,"Dark and humorous with an unexpected turn of events.

I think one of the best things about Parasite is that for a foreign film it doesn't feel like a foreign film. At least in my experience foreign films always felt somewhat polarizing like either you watched them or you didn't and I feel like this movie is a good starting point. It feels very familiar even though its Korean and I didn't expect it to be that way.

I highly recommend watching.","May 29, 2020"
10,Best film I've ever seen,"Had a free screening at our campus. What I like is that it could have been mean spirited at any point, but it seems to have compassion for every party involved, no matter their transgression you understand and sympathize with them. This is way different than current day films, such as Knives Out or the other nominees where the social critique involves mockery and derision of the 'villains'. I wonder if it's the difference between hollywood white privilege vs korean cinema coming from an entirely different position of the socio economic hierarchy.","Jan 26, 2020"
10,A realistic movie without being necessarily realistic,"The movie is very well planned, if the viewer isn't watching closely he or she may lose a few details that make this movie so great. The movie makes people feel every type of emocion and makes you understand different types of realities... I really recommend and better to watch it without any clue of what is about to happen.","Feb 20, 2020"
10,Masterful film making,"I don't what to say about this film apart from how this film is masterful film making. I don't even want to give a synopsis for this film as this film is best experienced with no knowledge whatsoever.

The plot is amazing and extremely gripping with every twist and turn. Likewise, the way it tackles the social themes is so intriguing and done so extremely well even if the theme has been done many times before. The entire cast is amazing and honestly not even one of them getting a nomination for best acting is quite the robbery. Huge praise to Song Kang-ho and Park So-dam especially, they gave amazing performances. The cinematography/set design is also impressive and uniquely correlates with the ongoing story. The use of staircase and lines to tackle the ongoing theme, while not subtle, is done extremely well. The soundtrack, while not exactly memorable, manages to elevate the tense atmosphere and keep people on the edge of their seats. Finally, the film is absolutely entertaining with the way it incorporates contrasting genres, black comedy and thriller, into one surprisingly cohesive and exhilarating movie.

THIS IS A MUST WATCH! It deserves best picture for a reason.","Feb 23, 2020"
10,A film that will keep you on the edge,"Parasite is a masterpiece and it is worth all the attention that it's getting. The script is very flawless and the cinematography captures the beauty of how the production designed each and every place. The actors executed their part very well and whenever they speak in English really entertains me and give the mood a comedic atmosphere. The whole film is very mesmerizing to watch and how you get to have a light comedy at the start that turned real dark by the end was a perfect blend on how to play the audience's emotions and get them fully engage in watching. I gave the film a 10/10 because the way they made the film was smooth, clean, and gorgeous in a way that you could get drowned in the details of every part of it.","Jan 24, 2020"
10,A MASTERFUL CINEMATIC STORY TELLING,"Exceptionally written, ingeniously directed, and profoundly acted, PARASITE is a masterpiece of its own. This cleverly layered and twisted film is a social commentary about class division that seemingly tied into a perfectly paced and balanced multi genre that is packed with metaphors, implied messages, and symbols. PARASITE is an accomplishment for cinematic storytelling and world cinema that engross, surprise, and shocks.","Jan 24, 2020"
10,The Best Film I Have Ever Seen.,"I made an Imdb account just so I could write this review. I watch a lot of films, typically one movie everyday and sometimes even two. Out of all the movies I watched, Schindler's List was my all time favourite. That film moved me in ways which no other film has managed to. I am a fan of Bong Joon Ho's work but none of his movies lingered in my mind with exception of "" memories of murder"", that film is a masterpiece. I watched Parasite at a local film festival and boy was I blown away by it. I have watched this movie more than 12 times and every time I watch it I discover something new about it. I just can't stop watching this film! No other film has had such a huge impact on me. Everything is just perfect. The story is unpredictable and extremely layered. Every shot has a visual subtext. The musical score is haunting to say the least. I fear that Bong Joon Ho won't be able to top this film and every movie that he makes after this will be compared to Parasite. I highly recommend everyone to watch this masterpiece.","Jan 19, 2020"
10,Very entertaining,"This movie was so enjoyable from start to finish. Didn't know where is was going and that's what I found captivating.

So refreshing","Jun 5, 2020"
10,Parasite (2019),I find the film's visual symphonic. The use of montage in such a way that creates a flow of revelations. Camera movements are buttery smooth and well executed. The concept of the film which is about the social classes has paid such an impact to the audience. Bong joon-ho used such a technique in which he showed us the things that we may not be aware of. The film did a great job on putting its audience on a thrilling rollercoaster ride of emotions.,"Jan 24, 2020"
10,What - a - picture,One of the best film I ever seen in my whole life. Masterpiece.,"Mar 1, 2020"

10,Parasite is a very rare film ...,"Parasite is a very rare film. IMDb have it listed as a 'Comedy, Drama, Thriller'. These three just don't do it justice. It certainly has some very funny moments ... but it's equally depressing and sad (both in a good way) as it deals with tough subjects like injustice, poverty and class. It certainly is a drama; each character has multiple situations ranging from normality to crisis. We watch as these scenarios merge and cultivate themes and topics to contemplate. Yes, you guessed it ... it's also a thriller; the storytelling beautifully builds up, twists and works to a crescendo.

However, the film has so much more. There's plenty of argument to add 'Horror, Romance or Crime' which are all blended into the colourful narrative. Plus, this film is the quintessential 'Family' film; yes, the families are in 'interesting' situations, but the shades develop and raise questions on many layers. The fact this film can do all of this and stay even remotely coherent explains why the film is rare. The credit should go to the sharp writing and directing of Bong Joon Ho and the brave and touching work of the actors.

Now ... it's a long way from 'perfect' in my opinion. I've scored this film a 10 here as it just crept into the required range with 91/100 using my own scoring system (I have my own detailed method). It's certainly true that some people won't enjoy this film. Of course, the genre mix I describe above may put people off straight away. Without saying too much that gives anything important away some might feel the underlying themes have been done before and that the film can feel confused and ambiguous (on a variety of subjects and positions). You may also need to deal with a film without an obvious 'hero', characters with whom you may struggle to empathise (especially by the end) and an 'unlikely' main plot and close.

Personally, none of these impacted my enjoyment of the movie in a significant way. I'd primarily put this down to the direction, screenplay and acting. There are small moments in the film, which resonate as they underpin the themes. I found 'Parasite' thought provoking and engaging throughout.","Jan 17, 2020"
10,Amazing,The best movie l've seen! I wanna see it again! You mast see!,"Jan 20, 2020"

MUST WATCH MOVIE,"Jan 13, 2020"
10,A melody of fine cinema,"Parasite is a melody of fine cinema. It hits all the right notes that attracts its audiences with just the right amount of everything it has to offer. Each sequence delivers the perfect pacing relative to the ongoing conflict, accompanied by beautiful cinematography and scoring. The cast delivers an engaging performance that brings a sense of true harmony with each other. It also combines all forms of genre really well without it being cramped or overbearing. It excels in nearly all creative and technical aspects, but what truly captivates its viewers is its masterful storytelling. Overall, Bong Joon-ho has crafted a beautifully dark and chilling story that transcends language and connects with millions. The film deserves all the praise that it gets not only for its impeccable storytelling but also for setting a greater standard in the cinematic landscape.","Jan 24, 2020"
10,An absolute masterpiece,"Parasite is one of the most original creative films I have seen in many years. Its tense, funny, heart warming, shocking, all in one film. The acting, and writing is absolute top notch. I can not recommend this movie enough.","Jan 23, 2020"
10,The best korean movie!!,"I love korean movies very much, but this, this is the first time i review a movie, because i really like it, and i heard Parasite won the oscar 2019 woow","Apr 27, 2020"
10,Socially and politically conscious film that mixes various genres masterfully,"Bong Joon Ho, the South Korean film director, producer, and screenwriter, is known for using social themes, mixing genres, and including black comedy with sudden shifts of tone in his filmography. Although Parasite (2019) is the first movie of his I got to enjoy, Okja (2017) and Snowpiercer (2013) have been on my watchlist for quite a while. I should seriously consider watching them when I'll have the chance. One of his trademarks is that his films are socially and politically conscious and he displays that strong subject matter while using black humor and bold saturated colors. He's only the second Asian director to win the Oscar for the best director (the other one is Ang Lee for Brokeback Mountain (2005) and Life of Pi (2012)) and the first one of Korean descent to do so, and I want to discuss the success of Parasite and why the movie is highly appreciated by most of the critics.

Writing nasty but lovable people isn't an easy task, but Parasite executed this trope perfectly. The movie follows the Kims - a poor family, who makes a living by taking odd jobs, such as folding pizza boxes. Things turn around as the adult son Ki-woo gets recommended as an English tutor for a teenage daughter of an upper-class family, the Parks. That's when the long-con started to take motion - soon after, Ki-woo sets up his sister Ki-jeong as an art tutor for the Parks' youngest son then both of them land their father a job as Mr. Park's chauffeur and their mother a job as the housekeeper, while keeping the fact that they are related a secret to the parks. This mischievous behavior would be fraud during most cases, but over here - you just couldn't help but root for the family as the way they set this whole plan in motion is impressive, to say the least. The other thing this movie managed to accomplish is displaying something that isn't common in popular media. The plot of a low-income family infiltrating an upper-class family is unheard of to me, and this new experience is a part of what made this movie great. Other than that, the other great factor is the way multiple genres, like family, drama, dark comedy, a political thriller, and horror are used here that question us what to expect from this movie and where the plot will lead. The serious major switch in the genre comes as the Kims have successfully infiltrated the home of the Parks and they take advantage of the upper-class family's absence to live in the mansion as if it was their own. Much to their surprise, the previous maid returns to the Parks residence and reveals that her husband has been living in their secret shelter for several years. Conflict arises between the Kims and the previous maid and her husband with Kims being held hostage. The situation quickly gets out of hand as the previous made is left in a critical situation back in the secret shelter, where her husband is tied up and the Kims have little to no time to clean up this whole mess as the Park are returning in a jiffy. This whole sequence, that consumed the middle of the movie, was the tensest part of the movie that shifted the mood of the movie while complimenting the plot masterfully.

Bong Joon Ho is no stranger to burying political and social comments here and there in his films. Seeing how the poor family and the upper-class family view some issues, you can notice a drastic difference, which perhaps influenced the decision made by the father figure in Kim's family Ki-taek. After they narrowly escape being caught in the Parks residence, they return to their home, which is ravaged by the storm, and everything is flooded. They're forced to spend the night in the homeless shelter, while the Park sees the storm as a blessing, as the next day is beautiful and they can make an impromptu party for their son. They don't even think about those damaged by the storm and the Kims are all invited to the party, either for work or entertainment purposes. All is going according to plan until the husband of the previous maid gets out and goes all out on Kims'. After he stabs Ki-jeong, the youngest in the Park family faints (as he has seen the husband of the maid before, thinking it's a ghost, there was a whole sub-plot around this than I skipped over) and Mr. Park wants to take him to the hospital pronto, barely even thinking about the stabbing of Ki-jeong. Ki-take makes an unexpected decision and stabs Mr. Park out of the blue. Now thinking about it, a lot of factors that we're going outside the plot lead to this decision but it was more due to the social injustice than the actions of Mr. Park before the incident. At least I'd like to think that's what leads to the result.

Overall, everything comes together perfectly in this film. What Bong Joon-ho accomplished here is a story with multiple layers that is entertaining without sacrificing its social commentary and themes of classism, social justice, capitalism, and greed - not only in South Korea but the whole world. It begins as a simple heist film unlike we have ever seen before, but it soon expands into multiple genres and takes a lot of unexpected turns. I want to applaud everything, the acting, cinematography, music, use of horror tropes, and all the messed up stuff that I'm not totally sure I understand yet, it all works together beautifully to bring an unforgettable experience.","Dec 4, 2020"
10,Parasite (Spoiler Free),"Last night was one of the most thrilling experiences I have had watching a film..

I attended a small arthouse theatre close to 15 minutes from my house. I finally saw a movie I had been yearning for some time. I am a little late to the party, in regards to my timing of this film. But I am ecstatic I got to view it in a theatre. I wanted to go in with no expectations, because typically I am let down. I have a tendency nitpick as a viewer, which can make some movies difficult to enjoy. I was aware that it had won best foreign film at the Golden Globes, and had received much critical acclaim. I cannot recall seeing another Bong Joon Ho film, except possibly The Host (in which case, it was so long ago- I do not remember). Either way, I was excited to see a movie that looked like a family drama, with perhaps some suspenseful elements.

As I sat in this small cleanly theatre, I noticed the majority of people were of Asian descent, and unless my eyes betrayed me, mostly Korean. I attend movies frequently and it was nice to see a very diverse crowd. As the lights dimmed and people munched on their popcorn, and drank their coke's; I sat there, by myself- as the only one in my row. Ready to have a fun experience, with what's been regarded as one of the best of the year.

The first portion of the movie, centers around an engaging Korean family who live in a lower-class part of the city looking for jobs. They live in a home that is underground, but can still see the street through one of the windows. The family consists of a young adolescent brother and sister as well as their middle-aged parents. The movie begins with raucous laughs and instantly makes you engaged with these characters. The first 30 mins is truly a full-blown comedy and my theatre could not stop laughing. In its own right it is a very effective comedy, that had hints of possible dread ahead. The hints at suspense begin when another family is brought into the story. We see how both of these families become entangled in each other's lives, and how the threads are tied together. The pace was slower in the early stages, but still immensely entertaining. Then there is a tonal flip. A character re-enters the story and you instantly feel tight. At this point you could not really tell where the story was headed, so I stayed in peak curiosity. Then comes a moment when dread absolutely swept over me and I felt as if the story was about to turn into a full-blown horror movie. I sat there in near dread, caught in my own amazement of what I was watching. The tension then softened a bit, but there was still an underlay of tightness. The whole tone of the movie had changed by this point, and you can feel the stress the characters are going through. As well as the fact that the viewer knows more than some of the characters on screen, so there are moments when you want to shout at the screen- DON'T LOOK THERE! Within a few minutes though, you are immersed in the new direction the story has gone in and what's happening. It was fun to follow the story's new direction, with a good level of suspense at this point. You can feel everything is on the brink of destruction, but its still being held together by a thread. Then the story levels off a little bit, heading an even different direction. In this sequence the story is setting up a finale, that will leave devastation. Once we get started in the third act, my jaw just about hit the floor and I was stunned. The final 20 minutes of this people was honestly breathtaking. The music, visuals, acting and the tone of the story hits you like a ton of bricks. By the time the final credits rolled, I sat there in utter amazement. It was the first time I left a theatre feeling utter euphoria. I was absolutely ecstatic with what I had just seen.

Parasite is a film that brings together a plethora of genres that all coalesce effectively. There is an underlying theme of classism and how the social construct of class impacts the psyche of the characters. But this is truly a story that has many layers, and the shifting tones create an atmosphere that is both eerily terrifying as well as holistically captivating.

10,Amazing movie. Clearly deserved oscar.,Trust me this movie will gonna surprise you! I watched it with my mother at home. We both surprised a lot. The story is taking shape very well. 2nd oscar coming from me and my mother. Thanks for great work everyone.,"Mar 11, 2021"
10,PARASITE 10/10,One of the best movies I have ever seen. It teaches a lot about things we spot in everyday life. Movie starts from comedy to thriller.,"Feb 20, 2020"
10,Simply amazing,"Parasite combines multiple genres through a captivating story and interesting characters. The contrast in lifestyles between the Kims and the Parks is portrayed through the amazing camera work and the incredible set design. The acting is simply jaw-dropping. I'm glad that these insanely talented korean actors are getting exposure through this film and I hope to see them on the big screen more often. This movie is simply amazing. It's psychological, comedic, frighteningly real. I would highly recommend you watch it, but avoid spoilers, as they will ruin the surprises.","Mar 15, 2020"
10,Masterpiece,"It's unsettling, it's funny, it's tragic, it's exciting, it's horrifying. This is a movie that will definitely grow on you the more you think about it. I like movies that are both entertaining and meaningful and this was definitely one of them. There are no ""villains"" or ""heroes"" in this story, just three different classes, (upper, lower, and lowest) striving to live while feeding on each other.","May 29, 2021"
10,Deserved the Oscar,"I was hearing so many good things about Parasite in December before the Oscar win but after it won the Oscar I knew I had to watch Parasite and boy was it a great experience. All the characters are fleshed out Bong Joo did a great job with the direction, the cinematography is top notch, acting awesome. The class divide story and the plot twist at some point (I won't tell you when go watch the movie) was all a great critique of the poor vs the rich and how they view each other. This film didn't necessarily have any heroes or villains just poor and rich and sometimes both sides are evil.","Aug 17, 2020"
10,Too real to be bad,This movie holds the pure depth of cinematic drama in 02 hours,"Feb 20, 2020"
10,Perfect. Nothing to say,"Yup. I've been Watching Bong-Joon-Ho's movie, And this is an end result. I won't say more. THIS IS A MASTERPIECE","Jan 12, 2020"
10,This film is fantastic,"I don't write long reviews, and I'm not going to here. All you need to know is that this film is one of the best I've seen in a long, long time. Acting was superb, directing was world-class, plot was near perfect. Seriously, go watch this movie right now.","Apr 10, 2020"
10,Amazing,"This movie was incredible!

Glad I saw this, and was introduced to this director through this movie.","Aug 20, 2020"
10,Best movie of the year,"Unquestionably the best movie of the year and the best foreign movie I've ever seen. A complete rollercoaster ride . Laughter, anxiety and sadness, felt all in 2 hours. Cinematography was amazing specially for the flood secenes. Memories of murder was one of the greatest foreign films I've ever seen and Boon Joon-Ho has managed to make another masterpiece.","Dec 23, 2019"
10,Absolute Brilliance,"It isn't every day that you come across a movie like this, a practically flawless one in my opinion actually. I have nothing but praise for director Bong Joon-Ho and I can now see why this movie has received much hype and praise over the past few months. This is a movie which not only shows a contrast between the rich and the poor but also the human condition and the will to survive. Don't worry, this review won't have any spoilers whatsoever.

To begin this praise train I have to first and foremost praise the acting of lead actor Choi Woo-shik whom delivered an incredible performance throughout this movie and brings a sort of charm during the first act of the movie.Another standout would be Kang-Ho Song that remains a recurring cast in the movies directed by Bong Joon-Ho and his consistency in the various movies he has directed absolutely shows why the director has so much trust in his acting capabilities.

A transition scene in particular which occurs at the end of the second act is really a beauty in itself and the transitions were absolutely stunning and beautiful which brings me to the cinematography and movie editing of the movie. The pacing was consistently on point where everything, even the change in tone is seamless. Along with the cinematography in which this movie is beautifully shot from the aesthetically pleasing rich kid house down to the semi-basement house in the suburbs.

Furthermore, another beauty of this movie will definitely be the score which was composed by Jung Jae-il which manages to convey emotion and tension during the second and third act of the movie which is something truly remarkable. Through music there are also hints to the sudden sort of change in tone I shall say which begins within just about the middle of the second act of the movie.

The plot of this movie is something I've yet to see over the many years of watching movies and this is where praised should be absolutely given for this ambitious plot where I could simply say, nothing written and the direction of this movie which keeps you guessing as to what this movie really is about should you dive deeper than the way the movie was promoted within the trailers shown for it. It is nothing short of extraordinary as you are unable to really see the change in tone coming.

At the end of the day, this movie questions how the rich could help the poor and in fact portrays mankind's strive for survival which in this case would be a better life in such a way that it isn't in your face. Plus, by the end of the movie, you really realise there is no real protagonist or antagonist, just people. People trying to live a happier life.

Thus, making Parasite the perfect movie where I am unable to criticise a single thing in this movie. Director Bong Joon-Ho has definitely earned my trust in his artwork and should to some extent be placed amongst the greats.","Jan 10, 2020"
10,A Masterpiece,"Thrill knows no language. My stomach was in a knot the entire film from start to finish, from the dark comedic beginning to its masterful pivot into horror and suspense at the midpoint. Parasite is a masterpiece and well-deserving of its status as Best Picture.","Jan 8, 2022"
10,I hope to see upcoming films at the same level as this legendary film,"When I watched the movie, I was not excited by the movie poster, but when it started from the first moment until the last moment of the movie, I could not even touch the magnificence of the story, the imaginative events and the music that amazed me, and the enthusiasm that struck me from the beauty and sequence of the story that I did not and will not expect to come. A film with the intelligence of the writer. Yes, I listened, laughed, was affected, tensed, sympathized, hated, saddened, and got excited. Just imagine in a film that combined all these feelings, so I evaluated it with this evaluation, and I told everyone that if the film did not take the OSCArs as the best film, the ceremony would be unfair, but my suspicion was true, and the film only what was said. He is literally legendary.","Jul 1, 2023"
10,Masterpiece between Rich and poor,Parasite is good movie of the year. What a story plot and execution was so nice.,"Dec 21, 2019"
10,Wasn't expecting this.,"When I hear the words ""A Korean film about class conflict"" I think it's gonna be something stupidly pretentious and needlessly experimental. But no, this film is a masterclass in direction, acting, suspense, camerawork, beautiful scenery, and even comedy. I was on the edge of my seat the entire time especially nearer to the end when the stakes became extremely high. Not to mention, This film has the best montage I've ever seen in film. I did feel the peach thing was a bit stupid and it's dumb that it was a huge plot-point. Bravo Bong Joon Ho. 9.4/10","Apr 8, 2020"
10,"Funny, messed up, depressing, scary. All of these things describe Parasite.","I have seen two films previously from the director of this film, Bong Joon Ho. Those being Okja and The Host. I like them both quite a bit. I think however, that Parasite is the best film I have seen from him. Don't judge this movie on the US trailers, I felt they did a really bad job marketing the film, they made it look really pretentious. In reality, the actual movie isn't anything like that trailer. This is a dark, funny, insane, crazy, and thought provoking film.

I won't get too much into the plot as I feel it's something you should experience for yourself but the film centers around this poor family, the Kims, who try and take advantage of a rich family, the Parks. Things get complicated from there.

The acting in this movie is phenomenal, everyone here gives their A game. The directing by Bong Joon Ho is simply masterful. The screenplay is smart, creative, darkly funny like a Coen Bros movie (it reminded me a lot of Fargo especially), and is pure insanity at points. The film doesn't take sides on either family, they both do pretty bad things but at the same time, you surprisingly care about them, despite how flawed both of them are. The halfway point and the climax are some of the craziest moments I have seen all year. The movie also does a great job tackling the issues between classes in Korea.

The cinematography is beautiful, especially those big wide shots of environments. The editing is exquisite, no scene goes on for too long, they make every second of this film matter, and I never felt bored by the film, the 2 hour and 12 minute runtime flew by for me. The music is also pretty good as well.

Overall, Parasite is one film you absolutely must see this year. It has great performances, amazing direction, one of the best screenplays of the year, and it keeps you guessing what will happen next. Go into this movie as blind as you can, the less you know, the better.","Dec 2, 2019"
10,Beautiful,"I really love the way they mixed thriller and comedy, when it got serious it got really serious, when it was funny u would laugh your ass off. Definitely one of the greatest films ever made. I really didn't want it to end, but all good things must come to an end","Jan 2, 2020"
10,Súper movie,"This movie is the best movie of the year, all scenes are amazing, and it has a very good message","Mar 20, 2020"
10,Perfection.,"There's quite a bit of hype around this film already, but going in I knew nothing about it. I prefer this, I rarely watch trailers for this very reason (the modern trend of giving too much away in trailers pisses me off). The opening is delightful, a young Korean family out of work and living in poverty, but looking out for one another, keeping positive and striving to help themselves. It's touching, heartwarming and even the slight squalor is beautifully shot. Good fortune finds it's way to them as the children begin tutoring jobs for a wealthy family living in the sort of show home that an episode of Grand Designs would die for. It's not until half an hour in, that this new hope gives way a little. Just a little crack, almost undetectable. What unfolds over the next two hours though is a masterpiece in tense deceit. I'm loathed to give too many details but suffice to say, this is a beautifully dark tale that reveals itself slowly and with such grace, it's nothing short of perfect. I don't think I can recall a film with such intense levels of humour and brazen deception built on the simplest of premises, desperation to survive. The plot, cast, cinematography, every damn facet, flawless. The deft twists of the characters as to who is good and who is bad, as the tension rises to unbelievable yet plausible levels is ridiculously gripping. Even the finale which after such mastery is bound to disappoint, does anything but. I know it's only January, but this surely has to be film of the year.","Jan 14, 2020"
10,"Gisaengchung, the genre-LESS film, a masterpiece","Parasite is the heart-breaking and mind-shattering story of a poor south Korean family slowly inserting themselves into the life of a much wealthier one, through schemes, intense plotting and brilliantly written twists. Disguising itself, at first, as a comedy layered with social criticism, the film reveals itself to be a raw dramatic thriller verging on horror of great genius, with moments that will literally take your breath away. Bong Joon-ho crafts a near-perfect movie, with top-notch careful directing, beautifully flawed and intense writing, heart-wrenching performances and emotionally charged visuals. But in the end, ""Parasite"", isn't a comedy, it isn't horror, it isn't a thriller and it isn't a drama, it is FILM and that's what is so painfully gorgeous about it. 9,8 / 10","Nov 21, 2019"
10,Top 10 material from this decade,"A well-deserved win for the behemoth of a movie. So many undertones are explored and subtly depicted through the runtime of the movie. If foreign language films are anything like this movie, it is bound to have more nominations from across the world for the Academy's best picture award. The movie fantastically talks about social stratification and class-divide and how struggle and entitlement eats up the humanity inside.The genius screenplay and plot-line is accompanied by artistic sense of cinematography and an incredible score. The ensemble cast have shown ingenuity in playing the characters. The one question that remains even after the end of the movie is who is the ""Parasite"" or is just the concept of hope for a Utopian world and fulfillment of all desires or simply our ""real"" society. Its a must-watch! The use of architecture, design, imagery and visual composition is magnificent. The daylight shows the better, a more hopeful and upper echelon way of life whereas the dungeons like basements and semi basements show how life feels trapped, difficult and how it ""stinks"" of poverty. Bong Joon Ho has masterfully drawn parallels and intersections between the two kinds of life and the chosen way to represent them, from an architectural stand point, says volumes. The camerawork is exquisite in depicting serious situations which have greater impact on the whole story. The parts to whole and whole to parts sequencing of shots brings to each scene a sense of completeness, yet a mystery that continues onto the next.","Jul 3, 2020"
10,A 2010 masterpiece,"Not many films in the past 10 years have made as strong of an impression as Parasite. The commentary of capitalism and the division of class and how it tears apart all families involved even shines through this growingly dark drama. Although, not an American film, its universal themes still amplify the ubiquity of a global issue.","Feb 2, 2021"
10,Masterpiece,"This film deals with the genre freely. The director's originality, completeness, artistry, and popularity were well harmonized.","Nov 12, 2019"
10,Wow,"Such a breathtaking movie! Both in terms of script, acting and look of the film. It's beautifully shot and wonderfully acted. Some really great twists and turns and unexpected moments.

Admittedly I've only ever watched one other thing from Korea and that is the latest Squid Games. This movie is made me want to watch more Korean movies.","Oct 15, 2021"

10,"Aesthetic, dark & political","First impressions: A striking contrast between the visual ambiance (smooth or pastel colors, cute) and the story (super dark).

It kind of recalled me A Clockwork Orange somehow. The dark humor, manipulations, the underlying terror settling in, the sudden violence, the social questioning.","Feb 22, 2020"
10,South Korean masterpiece,"This work is one of the greatest films that I have seen ... Indeed, it is a masterpiece in the fullest sense of the word in terms of direction, which was a professional of all professionalism or the method of sequencing events that were easy for the viewer and makes him coordinate with the events without even feeling ... more on that The performance of the actors that was so great that you feel that you are involved with them in the events or rather merge with it ... The bottom line is this movie is creativity creativity creativity","Feb 16, 2020"

10,Intelligent and thought provoking,"Who are the parasites? This is the question going through your mind throughout the film. That's why this film is so good. The rich family living their lives without a care in the world. The poor family desperate to survive. Are the rich family kind, selfish or both? What about the poor family? Who are the parasites? Both families? When the rain comes and floods the ""poor people"", the rich family can only say how pleased they are to have the rain. But is it because they are selfish or are they blissfully unaware? This is story of how people view the world after experiencing two different lives. It's brilliant, full of questions and thoughts.","Feb 5, 2021"

10,"PARASITE - The less you know , the more you will be surprised!","First of all let me tell you my experience about Parasite. Back in time as everyone was talking , I thought ""okay it has to be something special that's why everyone is recommending"" and on top of that the film won Best Picture in Cannes film festival , was also nominated by Oscar in couple of categories. Also won several awards in Golden Globes. And when there is so much hype about something obviously we all want to watch it immediately. But as it was not released in India , I had no options other than to wait..

Finally after huge public demand they released the film in several multiplexes. Sadly on a very low scale. After some time I watched it and My God , What an experience! I was just looking at screen with my wide eyes open throughout the runtime. I wanted to understand what Director is trying to convey through it. I had my imagination about it like ""oh it'll be some commercial sci-fi alien film or zombie action film"" , you know something like that... But HELL NO. It was nothing like that , infact not even close. With every upcoming scene my all the imagination was fading away like a weathery cloud. As if the Director made it just to prove me wrong. Jokes apart but it was really unexpected. Every scene was interesting and metaphorically shot. Visual storytelling is one of the beauties of Parasite. And of course those periodic twists. Damn.

Shortly , The film was engaging and especially if you haven't watched the trailer or if you don't know anything about the plot , this film will surprise you so much more.. and I have personally experienced it. During the whole time I couldn't even imagined or guessed whats going to happen next ?

So , you can watch this film. You should watch this film and try to find what it tries to speak.

It started as a black comedy , then it became a family and social kind of drama , after some time it was a thriller , again after some time it was a mystery , later it was a revenge , climax was horror and ending was a tragedy! I mean what else can I say? Seriously man that Director 'Bong Joon-ho' is a South Korean diamond. After Parasite I watched some of his previous work and was mesmerized by this man's vision and brilliance of storytelling. 'Memories of Murder - 2003' , 'Okja - 2017' , 'The host - 2006' , 'Mother - 2009' are some his movies that I want everyone to watch. This are more or less equally good movies that you will not regret after watching.","May 25, 2021"
10,Best Picture of the Year!,"This movie is phenomenal, it's epic, exciting, funny, has the awesome ultra-violent in the third act of the movie, it's so unique and powerful that it's so cool!

10,Totally worth it,I just couldn't expect to this. Brilliant and captivating. Deserves every damn prize,"Mar 23, 2020"
10,"Ineffably great, hard to classify film focused on class warfare","It is hard to talk about this film without spoiling it surprises, so I will basically write a love letter to Bong Joon Ho's brilliant new movie. He effortlessly builds tension, while bringing so many other elements (Slapstick! Horror!) in telling the story a poverty-stricken family climbing for higher ground on the backs of the elite. It is a moving, funny, and above all else enlightening take on how the war of the classes leaves many, many casualties. Best film of 2019.","Nov 3, 2019"

10,PARASITE: OUTSTANDING.,"PROS:

EVERY SINGLE THING.

The acting is great. The pacing is amazing, it always feels like something is happening and you won't get bored. The message isn't scream out at the audience, you need to read between the lines. The characters are well developed, there's no hero or villain. You can empathize with every character and understand why they do what they do. There are violence, comedy, action, suspense and romance. Honestly, I wasn't expecting much, and I find myself really.

CONS:

Not for me, but some people may find the ending really weird and unsatisfying. But read some reviews and probably you would understand what's the message behind the ending.","Jan 3, 2020"
10,Not what i expected!,"I was looking forward to watch some kind of survival thriller,that's what i thought from the title but it was completely different but still so convincing.It is a high quality movie and a must watch to understand the level of korean thrillers.After watching this movie only one word came iut of my mouth ""Brilliant"", and understood why it got 10 mins standing ovation at film festival 💥","Oct 25, 2019"
10,Brilliant Masterpiece of South Korean Filmmaking,"O.M.G... I knew Parasite was going to be good, but I didn't expect it to be THAT good.

Parasite starts off with a simple premise. Yet, with what Bong Joon-ho accomplishes in this film is worthy of praise and reward. Every twist and turn is unexpected and the execution of the film is perfect.

No other word I can use to describe this film: perfect.

Every character in this film is ones that viewers can emphasize with. The themes of class conflict (also seen in Boon-ho's Snowpiercer) prevails in this film as well. It's stunning to see these dynamics play out.

In parts where you expect to know how the story will turn out, another curveball is thrown that catches the viewer off-guard. Yet nothing destroys the suspense of reality. There were moments in the film where I was biting my nails in suspense.

5/5. The timing, pacing, and execution of this film will be studied in future generations of filmmaking. This is by far one of the best films I've seen this year.","Jan 13, 2020"

10,The Best Film Of 2019,"This is not only the best film of 2019 but one of the best in the decades. The film does a wonderful job at crafting the story of the Kim family and their journey with the Parks. The film makes subtle nodes to the class differences between them which doesn't come across as preachy or in your face, which all adds up to a stunning ending. But outside of the class differences, the movie acts a good comedy as well in which you will be smiling at all the various antics of the Kim family does in order to fulfil their plan. Even though this might be a foreign film for non-Korean audiences and you have to read subtitles, you have to look past that because once you do, you wont regret watching this marvel of a film.","Jan 15, 2020"
10,Amazing movie,"One of the best movies I have ever watched in years. The life of the rich and the poor yet never felt cliché, not even once. Very unpredictable and the anxiety you get from watching the movie is thrilling yet you don't know which character to root for because they have their own stories. So please watch it,, you won't regret it.","Nov 14, 2019"

After the movie i feel like someone punch my head, and then i feel so bad at something that ican't explain what exactly it is.

Highly recommeded to see it.","Oct 5, 2019"

10,"What if you are a parasite, host or neither is...","A question in my mind after watching this movie is if I'm one of these roles and what will I do?

""Parasite"" presents the situation that the worst outcome might happened when the different social classes meet. The depiction of bottom-class people in this film are both sympathized but greedy. Although rich people are kind, they just can't stand the smell and life quality from bottom-class people, and they express their emotion too obviously to bottom-class people. This is humanity, and there is no correct answer, but we can think deeply in this issue. And what if you are neither parasite nor host, would you try to narrow the wealth gap or just be a bystander and do nothing?

It's very meaningful that most people give more concerns and think about each other after seeing this film.","Sep 17, 2019"
10,Well-crafted story,This movie rightfully won the Oscar for Best Picture. Some think it was entirely political as this is the first ever foreign language film to win this award.

10,First Hit: I really enjoyed this story as it dives from the hilarious into the absurd.,"First Hit: I really enjoyed this story as it dives from the hilarious into the absurd.

We are introduced to this South Korean family (the Kim family) as they are getting ready to eat. The below ground level home has few street-level windows as they look up from the table to see a drunk young man peeing on a wall near their home.

We can tell the family is barely making it financially from the looks of the room, the view outside the room, and by their sparse, cryptic, and entertaining conversation. However, they seem to be engaged in their lives and hopeful because they are talking about the language of scheme making.

The family consists of the father Ki-taek (played by Song Kang-ho), the mother Chung-sook (Jang Hye-jin), the son Ki-woo (Choi Woo-shik), and the daughter Ki-woo (Park So-dam).

Ki-woo's friend Min-hyuk (Park Seo-joon) comes by their home, wanting to give Ki-woo a present. It is a rock sculpture that is supposed to bring economic well-being. Because Min-hyuk has to leave town for a while, he tells Ki-woo about a tutoring gig he wants him to take over while he's gone. The subject of his tutoring is a rich high school girl named Park Dye-hye (Jung Ji-so). Dye-hye's mother, Park Yeon-kyo (Jo Yeo-jeong), Min-hyuk says, isn't too bright, so he should easily pass the interview. Ki-woo expresses his worries that he'll be found out and may not be good enough, but Min-hyuk assures him that even though he's only got a high school education, he'll dazzle the ditzy Mrs. Park.

When asking Min-hyuk why he's giving him this offer, Min-hyuk explains that he didn't want one of his college friends doing the gig because he loves this girl, wants to date her when she's out of high school and knows that Ki-woo is a true friend and wouldn't cross him in this way.

Arriving at the Park home, he's let in by the housekeeper Gook Moon-gwang (Lee Jung-eun). Walking through the house, he's amazed at what a sizeable beautiful home it is. It's very modern and filled with all the luxuries he's never known and only dreamed about. The interview with Mrs. Park goes very well, and he's hired to tutor Dye-hye. Noticing artwork around the home, he asks about it. The mother explains that it is her wild son who shoots bows and arrows around the house. But he's also an artist and Mrs. Park thinks her son could be compared to the Andy Warhol anointed artist Jean-Michael Basquiat.

Seeing an opportunity and because the family is wealthy and pays well, he says he may know of a young woman who is an Art Therapist that could work with the boy to become a great artist. Getting home, he tells his family about this and his sister is ready to do her part and take on a new role as Art Teacher and Therapist.

I'll leave the rest to your imagination, but let's just say the family all participates in this adventure.

But when the wealthy family takes a camping vacation, and the old housekeeper comes to collect something she left behind, the whole story starts to turn towards the macabre.

Parasite is a perfect name for the film, and it is not easy to pin down all the aspects this film offers the viewer. As it won the Cannes Palme d'Or for best film and I can see why.

Song, as the patriarch of the Kim family, was exquisite in embodying this character. Early in the film, when he announces that they need to leave the windows open when the street fumigators come down the street, I knew I was in for a ride. It was perfect for setting up his mindset. His silent looks while driving Mr. Park around after he learns that the Park's think he and his family smell, are spot on. Jo was excellent as Mrs. Park. Her expressions when buying into the stories shared Ki-woo and Ki-jung were priceless. She was the perfect foil and focal point of the Park family. Choi was terrific as the Kim family young man. His wistful story at the end of the film about finding his father was excellent. Park was sublime as the Kim family daughter turned instant Art Therapist. Her embodying the story she made up for herself was funny, engaging, and perfect. Jang, as mother to the Kim children, made me laugh. Her actions and responses during the opening scenes while the family was eating were scene-stealing. Lee Sun-kyun was outstanding as Mr. Park. His command of the family as he waltzed in from work was evident and clearly identified who was in charge of the Park family. Lee Jung-eun, as the housemaid for the Park family, was engaging. Her arriving back to collect what she left in the basement under the kitchen opened the door for the film to move to another level. Bong Joon-ho and Han Jin-won wrote a wildly entertaining screenplay that had both funny and dark edges. Joon-ho was outstanding directing this film. Some of the shots, especially as the family tried to get back home during a major storm, told much of the story. The direct downward view of the slums in which they lived, being flooded, was telling. Just as the shots of the luxurious home where they worked were just the opposite; clean, crisp, and wonderfully shot with various angles.

Overall: This is a contender for Best Foreign Film and maybe even Best Picture.","Oct 12, 2019"
10,The Best Original Story of 2019,"Easily, one of the best movies of the year, because of many aspects: First, the acting is awesome, really strong performances by everyone. Second, the story is very interesting. And last but not least, the sequence of events in this movie is one if the year's best. I mean, every act is great on its own, but if you put them all together, you will witness a Masterpiece, and if you watch any of them by itself, you will get an amazing short-film. Considering thd Oscars, this one is a strong nomination for Best Foreign Language Picture and I wouldn't be surprised if it gets a nomination for The Best Picture award.","Dec 30, 2019"
10,A masterpiece,"Finally a masterpiece. It has been some time since I watched suck a brilliant movie. Put it simply, everything about it is perfect. The story, the acting, the cinematography, the score...and the amazingly beautiful end. Applauses!!","Oct 23, 2019"
10,Breaks the boundaries of just a movie,"Parasites are a social movie whose main theme is a discussion about poverty. In the main role, a family of poor people who get a job in the house of the rich. At first glance, it seems that the name ""Parasites"" obviously expresses the author's opinion about the main characters. But then you realize that the main characters are shown with great love, and the author would not like to call them guilty. But the rich family is not exposed as antagonists, they are naive, kind people, as much the main characters as the poor. It is not possible to call the third family parasites. Then who are the parasites? I would say that the parasites in this film - and this is what makes movies valuable to me-are rather States, social statuses. Poverty, as well as wealth, are parasites, they set boundaries, they deform people, and people are not really to blame, people by their nature do not seek evil, they are only victims.

If we talk about the plot and the overall feeling of the picture - it is dynamic and interesting, the dialogues are cute, the plot is constantly developing and growing, and resembles Kafka, in the sense of growing and growing absurdity. In General, the film is a Comedy, it is easy to watch, through the whole picture there is a light humor and irony, from this the ending becomes surreal - it is even more felt that all the characters are victims.

Also in the film there is an extremely pleasant and easy symbolism. Very interesting is accompanied by the movement of the plot and characters of the symbol of water, which at one point becomes a flow, a symbol of the smell, which becomes smell, the use of characters for foreign words, the idea of ""plan"", which gradually develops one of the characters, the stone that brings wealth and relationship of the hero with him. This gives room for intellectual play and a more complete immersion in the picture and situation.

It is impossible not to say that the film is damn beautiful and flawlessly shot. I would like to say something about dialogues - sometimes they are so vital and interesting that it takes your breath away. I liked the ending very much, apparently the author still comes to the sad conclusion that no matter what, poverty can not be overcome, you can not cross the boundaries that the characters are trying to break.

10,Best film of 2019,"I've never seen a film build up, so artfully, the desire in its audience to see a rich person get killed just for being rich. So well done. The twists and turns, the comedy, the horror. Flawlessly crafted film.","Mar 9, 2020"
10,Instant legend,"The movie was excellent in combining multiple genres like comedy, thriller & drama which is difficult to pull off. It definitely stood out of mass movie productions with its story, characters & plot twists.

Parasite has couple of things in its story which left question marks in my mind, but didn't effect it negatively.

My 10/10 is weighted by the fact that this kind of movie is very rare and the originality of the story leaves the viewer almost constantly surprised by the next turn of events.","Feb 2, 2020"

I would recomend going in blind as you'll get a better experience but reading the description won't spoil anything. Also - don't watch it in dub, I promise the sub is way more efficent and WILL make the movie better.

The only reason for rating it 8/10 is because it isn't my favourite movie, there's some flaws and rabbit-holes but the diector did confirm that Parasite will be turned into a series.","Nov 18, 2020"
10,A Flawless Film,"A technically flawless film, director Bong Joon-ho has created a modern film classic that, not only transcends the language and cultural barriers separating it from the rest of the world, but has resonated on such a level allowing it to take home multiple Academy Awards at the 2019 ceremony, including the coveted ""Best Picture"" award.

If you aren't into foreign movies because of the subtitles, I'd still highly recommend seeing this. He is such a master of image and setting that it conveys as much as the dialogue.

10,What did I just watch....?,"I hate myself. I hate myself for not seeing this movie sooner.

Holy hell...that was just...INCREDIBLE! This is seriously the greatest film I've sat through. This was the biggest emotional rollercoaster I've ever been through. Give me any genre, this movie will cover it masterfully. This was a masterpiece. A masterpiece that greats like Martin Scorcese have yet to feat. You have no idea how hard that is for me to say because I adore Scorcese's movies. And like many, I regard him as one of the greatest filmmakers of our time next to Spielberg.

Bong Joon Ho can't get more possible praise because his work, and his breathtakingly talented cast was just amazing! I think I just watched a classic. A modern classic that will be studied for all time to come. I was happy that Parasite won most of their awards at the Oscars, including establishing a landmark for the Oscars by being the first non-english film to win Best Picture. But after watching this masterpiece, If Parasite didn't win Best Picture at the Oscars this year, and it went to films like Joker, 1917 or OUATIH, it would be the worst Oscar year in history.

I'm telling you, if you don't watch this, you can't consider yourself a true movie lover, because this movie has made it practically impossible for all succeeding Best Picture winners to live up to this.

WATCH IT! Final Rating- 70/10","Apr 18, 2020"

10,A little fantastical journey that reflects the harsh and unfortunate reality.,"The dark satirical thriller, directed by Bong Joon-ho, began in a very scampering fashion with the mention of the word ""metaphor"" for countless amount of time. And as you'd usually expect from a Bong film, the metaphor then played a key role throughout yhe film as the name - ""Parasite"" - suggests. Though, it depends on how you take it & what you'd like to call it because ""stairway"" remains as another option as well. How? That's the beauty of this two hour long flick. Why? Let's discuss!

And to begin with, there's the plot that on paper didn't particularly make a lot of sense as it's expected from a satire in general. But the layers beneath and the sui generis usage of the metaphor illustrated the beauty, giving the film a base to build upon. No matter how unrealistic and chaotic the occuring events were, the joyousness kept emanating throughout while keeping a lot of space for sympathy and questions in a sublime pace and lighthearted tone initially. Supported by a colourful yet limited and very important cast with a lot of depth. Each and every actors, in their respective roles, probably have outdone themselves in that regard.

On a technical note, the cinematography in particular, deserves a lot of credits. Hong Kyung-pyo managed to capture the essence of two types of Korea, something which was extremely important for the film in itself, while keeping everything so simplistic and relatable. The entire set-up of the film, that provided the innocence and realistic touch, deserves a lot of extolling. At the end, the editing acted as needle that knitted everything together. Supervised by CJ Productions (and of course, Bong) with a tight budget, it'd be totally unfair not to mention how impressed I've been by their mind-blowing piece of work.

But everything aside, what packs the ultimate punch? The theme of differences of classes and how it's showcased through the ""stairways."" Call it pessimistic as you may like, or realistic for the sake of argument, the harsh reality doesn't change. That said, do you stop dreaming? No. But sometimes you get carried away in the sea of hopes, which may be ""greed"" for many. The dependency on lower classes & prison of wealth is something the film depicts so very uniquely. And the ending eventually solidified whatever, pessimistic for some and realistic for many, Bong wanted to claim; or rather ask you. With a lot of differences of opinions on its simplistic yet so complicated ending scene, one thing remains certain - you're bound to fall in love with this masterpiece, that sure does have the potential to snatch the ""Best Picture"" award at the gala night of Academy Awards 2020!","Jan 29, 2020"
10,Insanely Brilliant!!!!!!!!,"Wow! This one really blew me away! The writing is just too good for words to describe. Each and every aspect of film making whether direction , acting , editing , production design, sound design etc. is just best it can get . When you see this movie you will go "" oh this deserves an Oscar"". And you got it right , it actually won the Oscar's. Too many reasons for it to win the Oscar's. The writer and director Bong Joon Ho simply deserves a standing ovation and then in true Korean style, a big bow down with folded hands!","Feb 26, 2020"

10,The Best Bong Joon Ho Movie So Far?,"A common factor between movie director greats such as Kubrick, Hitchcock, Wes Anderson, Tarantino and more are that they tend to make movies so unique that you cannot just categorize it into just one genre. Bong Joon Ho should be considered to join those greats on the list.

If I want to watch a movie with unique storytelling, powerful characters and unexpected twists, this is the director I go to. The only two memories that I have for Bong are Snowpiercer (one of the best sci-fi movies that is more than just a typical sci-fi movie) and Okja (among the best Netflix movies ever), but those are memories I cherish. Move along, you two, because Parasite not only knock those two aforementioned movies off as my best Bong movie, but it may be the best Korean movie I have ever watched.

The movie about two families of vastly different wealth gaps brought insight into the faults of our society, especially how we perceive the rich and poor. The poor Kim family needed to make ends meet found an opportunity when the son got a job opportunity to work as an English tutor at the rich Park family's daughter. That became a domino effect as one by one, each Kim family member schemed to work for the Park family through ingenious ways but not all was rosy as it seems.

I'll stop here as if I continue on, I will spoil the story. It has twists so shocking my jaw was on the floor multiple times without me realizing.

Parasite, just like other Bong movies, crosses over different genres with relative ease. It is a black comedy, a satire and a thriller all in one. To call it a ""Family Tragicomedy"" as what the trailer suggests is a gross understatement for what it is worth. It is not a tragedy. It is not a comedy. It is not even an amazing piece of art. No, it's a revolutionary masterpiece only Bong could make.

As for the other elements, the acting is sublime, the cinematography flawless and the dialogue humorous and realistic. I could not pinpoint a single flaw in the movie.

In conclusion, I was not surprised at all when Parasite beat Once Upon a Time in Hollywood for the Palme d'Or because after seeing it, I had nothing but praises for the movie. Worth seeing the movie more than once if you have the time to do so. Do not miss this movie at all (and bring along a cup of dry ram-don with optional sirloin steak, if you need to).

10,Black mirror of this society.,"This movie is the real picture of this society. Some of them loose their homes and sleep in public places and others find the same rain refreshing in their cars. Some of them say they are their where they should be but never see the potential those peoples have. They are sleeping hungry just because no one gives them chance. Kim family told how easily they can get what rich peoples have but they should not be there because they are weak and deserve that lower place. That girl of park family fall in love with Kim's son but just because he was sitting near her what if he was a servant she would have kicked him, as simple as that. We talk about changes but still fear what this society thinks and somewhere we know we can rise but that sound never comes out just because of this noise of them. Many morals this movie can give but for me the best part was this brain is a bridge and as soon as we increase our thinking 'A cockroach can eat the food of Those rich pets'","Mar 19, 2020"

Do you want to see a movie that will have you conflicted on who you're rooting for? Regardless of your answers, see Parasite. Parasite ticks along quietly until it is booming in your ears. The symbolism varies. Sometimes it is obvious, Bong Joon-ho might as well have made the subtitles spell it out. But other times it is more subtle, and you might realize a connection or symbolism days or weeks after. Bong Joon-ho is a master at that. The conversation that it sparks is worth the $13-20 it costs to see the film. Parasite has made me think more than most films I've seen.

10,"It isn't an easy ride, and as with life in the non-metaphorical world, the destination is uncertain. You'll see strange and wonderful things along the way.","It is always exciting to see what the Frenchies decided was film of the year as it never fails to be a better pic than whatever the Hollywood menagerie showers with a critical accolades come Springtime. Little did I expect Cannes Film Festival to award the prestigious Palme D'or this year to a director who has been one of my least favorite filmmakers...until now. Bong Joon-ho's English film debut, 2013's SNOWPIERCER, struck me as overrated and dumb while 2017's OKJA was cartoonish and ham-fisted. It didn't help that he'd relegated two of my favorite actors, Tilda Swinton and Jake Gyllenhaal, to cringe-inducing career-low sideshow performers. Besides that, I just couldn't vibe with his grotesque and bumbling concoction of family-friendly cuteness, ultra violence, and quirky humor. It reeked of trying too hard and failed to land with me at every turn. With that said, let me be the first and most surprised person to say with no reservations PARASITE is easily one of the best movies I've seen this year. However, there's the other genetically engineered super pig in the room: PARASITE has an awful lot in common with last year's Palme D'or winner SHOPLIFTERS. Putting aside that the former is a Korean production and the latter was Japanese, both films follow the lives of a poor family as they struggle on the fringes of society, running cons and scams to get by in a callous world. They are held together by their honest love for one another, and their example is set juxtaposed to the neglectfulness of a consumerist society that allows so many to fall through the cracks in the first place. But the main way that Joon-ho one-up's his award-winning predecessor is with an incisive sense of humor suffused in each character, a humor that is immediately, physically translatable despite the language barrier. It works here so well precisely because it's reigned in and understated throughout the film, making the more manic parts hit harder - such as when Park So-Dam apathetically lights a cigarette on a lidded toilet spewing flooded sewage out the sides. The class conscious themes that have pervaded Joon-ho's science fiction offerings up to this point are given a much greater sense of immediacy and relatability as we watch this struggling family elbow their way into the good graces of a rich, privileged, and naive family. Beside the obvious ""haves vs. have-nots"" one would expect from this scenario, there's clearly an exploration of the structures that relegate people into servitude and poverty for generations, not just by the wealthy elite but by the pervasive mechanisms of misfortune that are maintained by the working class as we claw at each other's throats for short-term gain. Believe the hype, PARASITE is well deserving of the praise it has received thus far. It's tense, hilarious, and poignant, and I'm forced to genuinely re-evaluate this director's output knowing that he knocked it out of the park this time.","Feb 3, 2020"

10,Trickling Down - Here's the Trick,"""Snowpiercer"" is certainly the most competent Marxist allegory I've yet seen, so I looked forward to ""Parasite"" as a more ground-level discussion of how vast wealth warps society and leads to dire results. It's class struggle, of course. But here it seems that Bong wants to put the lens over a peculiarly American idea: ""trickle down"". ""Trickle down"" - here it is, in color. Here it is: in detail. Complacency and entitlement at the top. Desperate scheming at the bottom. Just what Regressive politicians all over the world say should happen. There is even a scene with an expensive table covered with crumbs - crumbs which are then swept on the floor - crumbs from the rich man's table, which are what the Kim family is supposed to be happy with. But they're not happy, and anyone who believes ""trickle down"" is a workable system should watch this story unfold and ask themselves: Is there dignity here? Is there peace of mind? Or is this all just leading to a terrible collision? A strange choice for the fat cats of the Academy to mark as Best Picture - but a story that everyone needs to see.","Mar 7, 2020"

Wow, just wow. I truly believe this movie, for me is going to be best movie watched for 2020. It's only January I know, but how the hell do you top this???","Jan 24, 2020"
10,Parasite Review,"Parasite is a modern day masterpiece even though it's not one of my favorite films nor is it my favorite film of the year. I have one tiny issue with the film but it is more of a nitpick. The film's message is a little on the nose but I don't have a huge issue with it but it is noticeable. Other than that, this film is perfect. There is not one bad performance in the movie. Cho Yeo-jeong, Park So-dam, and Kang-Ho Song are standouts from the film. All 3 of them have some of the best acting of the year. Their work with a fantastic script that is incredibly well written and clever makes their performance so much more enjoyable. Another aspect I loved was the cinematography. The film's slow camera movements and slow tracking shots look absolutely beautiful which go along great with the fantastic production design. The film's story and themes make this film incredible. The story of this poor family slowly infiltrating a rich family only to find out that their house is not what it seems. It's so incredibly tense. You never know what is going to happen next and it's always surprising to see what eventually happens. The film has themes of class divide and class warfare throughout which are very profound. The rich family says these lines about how great their life is while the opposite is happening to the poor family. Every time this occurs, you see how the poor family reacts and makes the scene and film itself dramatically more tense. Another thing I liked about the film was the score by Jung Jaeil. His score adds so much more to the tension. I know I'm using the word tension a lot but that's what this film is. A constant build up of tension scene by scene until it all culminates in the finale. For me, each passing scene left me more and more on the edge of my seat. One final aspect I want to touch on is the humor. Most of the jokes are cleverly written and while some of the jokes may not be that funny, I do appreciate how they were cleverly inserted instead of incredibly forced. Except this film to be on a bunch of Top 10 lists at the end of the year. Overall, Parasite is a fantastic film with great acting, great cinematography, and a powerful story about class divide even if its message may be a little too on the nose.","Oct 30, 2019"
10,"""Parasite"" Crosses the Line","In the midst of Writer and Director Bong Joon Ho's ""Parasite"" wealthy Korean High-Tech CEO Dong-ik Park, played by handsome bold Sun-kyun Lee, describes to his wife Yeon-kyo, played by beautifully capricious Yeo-jeong Jo: His new driver Kim, played by brilliantly overwhelmed Kang-ho Song. Dong-ik says of Kim, ""He never crosses the line."" Consequently, he hasn't had to fire Kim.

Paradoxically, Bong's ""Parasite"" purposely 'crosses the line', often amazing us or has us thinking, WTF? That's the inspired genius of Bong and Jin Won Han's screenplay, and Bong's visionary art. There's the curious dynamic. Aside from genuinely charming Woo-sik Choi, who plays Kim's son Ki-woo (also known as Kevin), the Kim and the Park families are essentially unsympathetic. ""It's all about them"". In the bizarre star-crossed love story, Kevin is in love in with the Parks' daughter Da-hye, played by cute innocent Ji-so Jung.

Bong and Jin construct their narrative: The poverty plagued Kim's insinuate into the lives of the very rich Park's. Innocuously, Ki-woo's best friend Min, played by bright charismatic Seo-joon Park, asks him to tutor Da-hye Park (Ji-so) while he's away at college. Really, Min asks Ki-woo to look after Da-hye, because Min is in love with her. Yeah, we get how that will go.

Min cautions that her Mom Yeon-kyo (Yeo-jeong) is rather unique. Initially, Yeon-kyo occurs as the unhappy wife and substance abuser. Although, Ki-woo is not the college graduate, his adept sister Ki-jung, played by beautifully acute So-dam Park, brilliantly forges her brother college degree documentation for his job interview with Yeon-kyo. He goes by Kevin.

Once acquiring Da-hye's tutor gig, Ki-woo deduces the way to get his sister Ki-jung (So-dam) as the art teacher for Park's troubled son Da-Song, played by untamed Hyun-jun Jung. Ki-jung poses as cousin Jessica. Similarly, the Kim's infiltrate as familial imposters in the Park household. Mom Chung-sook, played by sensible Hye-jin Jang, replaces legacy Housekeeper Moon-gwang, played by solid Jeong-eun Lee.

Now, the poverty riddled Kim's vicariously roll in wealth and luxury. At the zenith of their dysfunctional excess, the family parties in complete inebriation in the pristine Park living room, while the Parks are on camping vacation. Naïve Ki-woo even fantasies of one day marrying Da-hye, the love of his very young life.

Eventually, Director Bong's narrative spirals into the absurd macabre at warp speed. Honestly, I was the only person laughing out loud in the theater at times. Surprise twists reveal. The absurd hysterical devolves into absurd hysteria. I believe Bong's inventive madness does serve his purpose.

In the quiet scene at the Park home, Ki-woo sadly yearns while looking upon all the beautiful rich people at a Birthday party. It's his life that might have been. Rather, it's his life that isn't.

Director Bong brazenly explores the very fringes of sociopathy with both artistic style and menacing humor in ""Parasite"". His narrative is ultimately about karma. Absolutely there are consequence for what we do. What we do, can and will come back at us.

Yes, ""Parasite"" is darkly hysterical, in your face provocative. It's great to look at with authentic performances. ""Parasite"" might be one of best movies of 2019. I really liked the movie a whole lot.

All that being said: ""Parasite"" is not my very favorite movie of 2019. Perhaps, humanity by its very design is dark and light. At least for me, ""Parasite"" fails in its balance of the dark and the light. Again, just saying.","Jan 3, 2020"
10,Can't say anything that hasn't already been said,"The subtitles might be a bit much for non-koreans but the movie more than makes up for it. I complained when it won eight million academy awards because of all the other great movies but now see why it is so praised. A serious contender for ""Movies better than Old Boy"".","Jul 31, 2020"
10,Parasite,"Parasite is a cinematic masterpiece that will leave you feeling both gut-wrenchingly uncomfortable and weirdly uplifted. The acting is top-notch, the plot is twisty and thrilling, and the social commentary will have you questioning the very nature of class and privilege. But let's be real here, the real star of the show is Bong Joon-ho's direction. The man is a genius and I will stan him until the end of time. If you haven't seen this movie yet, cancel all your plans and go watch it. Trust me, you won't regret it (except maybe for the fact that you'll never be able to unsee that iconic stair scene). 10/10, would highly recommend to anyone looking for a mind-blowing film experience.","Jan 21, 2023"
10,Truly masterful film mixed with metaphors galore.,"This is something that stays with you for life. Whether good or bad, it shows it. Never have I seen a movie about classic stereotypes and used them in such a creative way that it's almost something entirely different.

Anxiety is something I'd define this movie as. It's edge of your seat, heart in your stomach and hoping. Then it happens.","Nov 14, 2019"
10,Wow,For sure the best movie I've seen of 2019. Nothing holds a candle to it.,"Jan 18, 2020"
10,Parasite is an excellent showcase of fantastic writing,"Parasite, is Bong Joon-Ho at his best, I was at first sceptical when I was about to see this movie because of all the praise it had gotten, I was afraid that the expectations that were placed on it were too high and I would come out of the film disappointed. I couldn't have been more wrong, Parasite is fantastic, it nails a lot of technical aspects such as: Cinematography,editing and its production design which is right up there as some of the best production design this year. These technical aspects however are just complimenting the excellent writing by Bong Joon-Ho who manages to flawlessly ease us from one genre of film to the next. It covers comedy, drama, horror/thriller, and also manages to dive into social themes like class systems. The way it does all of this is so subtle, it doesn't go on a rant talking about the way people act when in different classes, it shows us, which I think is a lot more powerful. It doesn't villanize any one class, both the rich and poor people in this film have their good and bad moments making it feel even more authentic. The acting is also really strong I can't put my finger on one performance as it does feel like a strong ensemble effort.

On the negative end however, some of the actions made by a character near the end of the film (Specifically the birthday party sequence), I just didn't agree that this would be something the character would do, I still found the actions performed to be entertaining, I just think this character could have made a different decision and would have as well.

Overall, Parasite is a very well directed, written and acted film, which is enhanced even further by its excellent, cinematography, production design and editing. With great performances from an excellent ensemble, Parasite is one of the greatest foreign films ever made and well and truly deserves its Oscar praise.","Feb 3, 2020"
10,"Brilliant, daring and original","Writer and director Bong Joon-ho has created a deranged masterpiece with Parasite. The first half of the movie was slow and repugnant to watch. Then, as the second half begins (when the former housekeeper shows up at night while the owners are away), it took a sharp turn into left field and became incredibly funny - though still very dark - and maintained the pace, humour and creativity right through to the end.

This is not a formulaic movie for Sheeple. If you like black comedy, originality, creativity, foreign/Korean films and bold storytelling, then this is the movie for you.

Laugh-out-loud, tears-in-eyes, wildly inventive stuff. Insane script, brilliant execution. Film art at its finest.","Feb 16, 2020"
10,Great Movie,"Portrait of a society. Of a World with a lot of humans that can be capable of doing whatever they can tu only SURVIVE. The analysis of a parasite in relation with the human is impecable. Details of the director carefully taken, like the Morse code, the kid being a Indian, the terror scenes strongly built up to make you scream from inside converge great in this movie. Comparison of a simple insect that that moves with his tiny arms and legs eating, evolving, wasting resources till it can't no more. Humans are a weir race and with this movie we can FULLY Understand a reality that lives.","Sep 2, 2020"
10,Best Film of 2019,"This movie was spectacular.

I was hesitant to watch it because of the subtitles, but once the film got rolling the brilliant subtitles allowed the viewer to read them and look up and see the rest of the action for the scene.

This will win Best Foreign Film. It should also take home the Oscar for best film of the year. The cast was brilliant, the story was amazing, and the writer-director at the top of his craft.

(The trailer shows a scene where one of the actors speaks in English. Perhaps that was done for a fickle American audience, of which I admit to be a member. But except for 3 or 4 lines in English, the rest is in Korean. I can just see the Hollywood studios gearing up for an American version, with Margot Robie and Brad Pitt. But whatever they do, they won't be able to top this magical film and utterly astonishing film making.)","Dec 24, 2019"
10,VERY MUCH DESERVED BEST PICTURE,"All I can say is this film was very well thought out on the acting, editing, directing, and just general storytelling. Love the diversity and highly recommend to watch!","Jan 29, 2021"
10,UNLIKE EVERYTHING YOU'VE EVER SEEN,"Parasite is such a fantastic movie that even its comparison with other amazing works can be dangerous. Korean director Bong Joon-ho has such control over the narrative and the camera that we often feel in a Hitchcock or Tarantino movie or even Italian neorealism. And it all flows smoothly.

The film begins as a custom comedy. Kim Ki-woo's family (Choi Woo-sik) lives so far below the poverty line in Korean society, that resides in a basement. They're always trying to capture wifi signals from surface neighbors, or leaving the windows open to benefit from the plagues fumigation made by the city hall on the streets.

The boy's life experiences a turnaround when a friend who is taking a trip abroad indicates him as a tutor to a girl he is teaching English. The friend is in love with the girl and trusts Kim, who knows why, to keep her safe.

Changing his name to Kevin, the boy begins his classes at the magnificent home of the fancy family, and, as expected, the girl Park Da-hye (Jung Ziso) soon falls in love with him. But your dream is much more ambitious: getting a job for your whole family in the house.

First, he convinces the girl's mother Yeon-kyo (Jo Yeo-jeong in great acting) to hire an art psychologist named Jessica, actually her sister Ki-jung (Park So-dam) for the hyperactive younger son. Using tricks, the Kim family's father and mother are soon admitted to the house. And on a Parks trip, they celebrate at their ""new"" residence.

After that apparent happy ending, everything changes in the movie. Former housekeeper Moon-gwang (Jeong-eun Lee) returns home and brings with her a great secret hidden until then. The outbreak of this surprise causes scenes worthy of a thriller, which only ends with the unexpected return of the Parks. What follows are comical scenes and amenities, until the terrible birthday of little boy Da-son (Hyun-jun Jung).

From there, chaos, destruction, and despair. And an ending. Or would it be two?","Dec 28, 2019"
10,A MUST WATCH,"Finally watched the most talked film of the year, and now I realise why it is the most talked film of the year. Yes I'm talking about Parasite, Directed by Bong Joon Ho. One of the best thrillers I've seen. Now talking about the story, it was going straight in the first half and was wickedly funny and then suddenly the twist arrives and it'll grip you edge of your seat. After that you can't move from that seat, and at last only sad. This masterpiece is also technically brilliant. Cinematography by Kyung-pyo Hong is damm good for a gripping thriller. And the BGM, it's not like the natural thriller, but the violin and the piano playing is perfect with the situation. And of course the outstanding performance by the ensemble cast. At last the film speaks about the differences between the higher class and the lower class people and also says ""You know What kind of plan never fails?? No plan at all "".","Dec 26, 2019"
10,"Stinging topicality and gut-wrenching violence, it's explosive filmmaking on every level.","""Parasite"" Review (10/10)

Snowpiercer director Bong Joon-ho has made a South Korean social satire that's also a genre-bending Palme d'Or-winning thriller of class struggle. It's best to go into ""Parasite,"" the Cannes Film Festival grand-prize winner by Korean filmmaker Bong Joon-ho, not knowing too much about what you're about to see; the better to let its sly power sneak up on you. A dark satire of the class divide in contemporary South Korea, it's the story of two families of four. You'll watch knowing you're in the hands of a master filmmaker; only wondering when it's over how certain effects were achieved (a sequence near the end is a wonder), and losing yourself in these characters: particularly the gentle, wide-eyed anxiety of Mrs. Park and the way that Ki-woo's father, a man who cheerfully recites his string of failed businesses, remains determined to somehow find a way to make his family prosperous again. The title metaphor becomes abundantly clear, is filled with vivid conversations that remind us how the Parks can't imagine (or don't care to imagine) how the other half lives. In one scene, they coolly discuss how poor people smell; like an old radish, says Mr. Park, or a rag that's been boiled. Ki-woo's family, however, seems to understand the rich all too well. What keeps you rapt in Parasite is the visual wit, every shot distills the movie's themes, and the richness of the characters and performances: Song's stricken expression as Kim Sr. is driven to murder by class resentment, Lee Jeong-eun's swift transformation from a calmly efficient housekeeper to a keening madwoman, and Choi's eloquent helplessness as his teenage protagonist watches this new world order gorily combust. At the heart of Parasite is the most gnawing evolutionary fear of all, the inability to protect one's family. Parents work to save their children but lose them, as children lose their parents and wives their husbands. The bonds are firm but can withstand only so much pressure before they fracture. Who are the real parasites? The poor who attach themselves to the rich or the rich who suck the marrow of the poor? The movie dissects the universal gap between the haves and the have-nots with shocking wit, stinging topicality and gut-wrenching violence. It's explosive filmmaking on every level.","Nov 6, 2019"
10,No words.,"I was really sceptical about ""Parasite"" in a way because of the hype, but I also had fate in the movie being good because Bong Joon-ho have delivered knock out after knockout. (Okja, Snowpiercer) Also I really like Song Kang Ho previous works. Most notably ""The Taxi Driver"", which left me crying my eyes out on a 8h flight. Do not recommend.

Anyways, Parasite is a masterpiece. Every time I thought I'd figured the plot out there was a twist. Everyone also kept going on about the ending and I was like, meh. Well, they were right about the ending.

Can't describe this movie. The plot is as indescribable as Fight Club, Get Out or Us.

Go watch it.","Feb 22, 2020"
10,It was a beautiful show,"An effective story, a wonderful show, began with comedy, but ended sadly.","Mar 27, 2020"
10,"Just a perfectly done movie, in every way.","It's a perfect movie in every way, words can't even decribe this satisfying feeling I got right now after I've seen it. It's an emotional rollercoaster that everybody need to experience. I can't even begin to describe it. Just watch it.","Nov 3, 2019"
10,Unbiased art,"When we were students at the art faculty, our teachers used to say, 'Art or an artist can't be unbiased; you pick a side and tell your story.' I never agreed with this notion. This film proves I was right.","Sep 22, 2019"
10,"On all social levels, human beings deserve equal respect","A family of 4 adults, all living in the same dingy basement apartment, are struggling to survive. Parents and young adult son and daughter, accepting all available, low paying jobs, putting up with indignities, exploitation and starvation wages. Life just isn't fair. When through an unexpected gift of a mysterious rock, the family's fortune begins to change for the better, there is a brief period of joy. By a series of clever deceptions, first the son, then each of the other family members gain employment with an upper class family. Soon feelings of guilt overcome them. Is their obvious fraud hurting others? How can anyone begrudge them their sudden good fortune? Is it all part of a higher plan?

This film is a delightful tour de force of not only the story and cast, but a powerful psychological journey as seen through the eyes of one young man, who is seeking meaning in his life; the opportunity to make his family proud, to accomplish great things. In the context of the story, it is a most selfless, loving heart, seeking a plan to help those less fortunate. This is a film filled with magic and warmth. There are very, very few films out there, with a message of optimism and reflection as powerful as in ""Parasite"". Having seen thousands of films in my life, this one receives a rare 10/10, and my highest recommendation. Don't let the sub-titles (or French Dub) scare you. You are definitely going to like this picture!","May 6, 2023"
10,Palme d'or? It's a gem!,"This is a very rich film ""with metaphors"" as the young hero of it might say. It is very compeling viewing from its first minute as the direction, writing and acting are very cleverly done. The themes of the have-nots against the haves and the cold-hearted versus the warmer-hearted people dominate the plot, which is thick. There is a lot of symbolism in it. Who are the real parasites, anyway: the poor or the wealthy, the caring or the indifferent? The tone takes a turn three-quarters of the way through from French-farce style to almost a horror film. However, it is worth engaging in until its conclusion, as it has some serious messages for the viewers and is a very wise work indeed. I can see why it won the Palme d'Or at Cannes in 2019; it's a gem.","Nov 2, 2019"
10,Meritocracy: it's metaphorical,"In a meritocracy, success and fortune are reserved for those who deserve it--those who develop solid plans according to their talents and abilities and who execute those plans through hard work and determination. Anyone can rise to the top, and for some lucky Cinderella, plucked from the cinders and gussied up in gowns, the meritocracy represents the heights of perfect egalitarian society: ""I started with nothing and ended up with everything I ever desired; you, too, can achieve you dreams, if only you try.""

The promise of unobstructed sunshine at the top of the mountain becomes justification for bitter competition, backstabbing, deceit, and callousness. You climb the crooked ladder until you make it to the straight one, and then, perhaps, when you at last feel secure, you can afford to be kind and confident and generous. ""It's easy to be nice when you're rich,"" the mother in this film (Jang Hye-jin) at one point observes.

But it's a very long and very crooked ladder, and sometimes the rungs give out beneath your grip, and sometimes they've been dangerously greased by those who climbed before you, and sometimes the ladder itself is simply kicked down--either by those above you or, just as often, by those staring up from the ground below. There are a lot of people trying to climb that one ladder.

But in a meritocracy, you can't blame the ladder or the other people trying to climb it. Nor can you blame the fact that all the good stuff is kept so many stories up instead of down at the ground where everyone can easily reach it. No, you must blame yourself. You should have tread more carefully. You should have climbed more quickly. You should have used a firmer and more precise grip, anticipated disasters, and known just when to leap. If you fail in a meritocracy, it's all your fault. You should have tried harder. Better luck next time.

Kim Ki-woo (Choi Woo-sik), the young man who is the main character of PARASITE, several times refers to ""metaphors,"" and the film itself is, of course, a metaphor. On a surface level, viewers are treated to a very thrilling, engaging, well-paced and well-plotted crime story. At all times, however, bubbling up from beneath the slick surface of this genre film, there are deeply personal, meaningful truths that should resonate with almost any viewer. These insights are rarely foregrounded. They are so subtly interwoven, in fact, that if you're like me, you may be completely surprised when the final shots of the film roll and you realize that you are emotionally devastated by the intimate, humanist story you've just witnessed. Bong Joon-ho's filmmaking is so extraordinary here that he'll make you fully invested in the lives of his characters without you even realizing he's done so.

I want to avoid spoilers here, but suffice it to say that PARASITE is a masterpiece--beautifully lensed, enthrallingly edited, superbly acted, and intimately involving.

South Korea has a population that is one sixth the size of the United States, and that population is stacked into skyscrapers in an area slightly smaller than the state of Kentucky. Higher education is widespread, so parents with means try to make their children stand above the pack by hiring them tutors and signing them up for extracurriculars and afterschool programs. I lived in Korea once, and the children I taught there were sometimes engaged in learning ten to twelve hours a day, six days a week--public school, English-immersion private school, piano class, soccer team, taekwondo, math camp, chess club, and so on. I routinely worked sixty to seventy hours a week on salary, but at bars I would meet young men my age who were expected to work far more than that, who slept at their desks so that they did not need to pry themselves from work for too long. As the father (Song Kang-ho) in the film at one point says, this is a country where fifty young men with college degrees apply for a mere security guard job. One can't afford not to struggle.

The themes of this story are not just localized to Korea, however. They are the story of global capitalism, and the specter of American materialism (and imperialism; note the ""Indians"") looms heavily over the film. Meritocracy makes cannibals of us all. It's nice to dream, and sometimes the dreamers who plan and struggle well enough can indeed climb out of the basement and into the sunshine, and how nice an ending it is when they do. But the film also makes it clear that sometimes all that planning and dreaming may be, maybe, just whims and fancy. More often, it seems, our pipe dreams are content to leave us with nothing more than the whiff of spewed sewage.","Aug 25, 2019"
10,Family Affairs,"Winner of the Palme d'Or for Best Film in Cannes 2019, to say «Parasite» is to speak of five shining stars in the cinematic firmament. When you have to spill blood in a film, you have to dose it with genius, hit the target and know where and when to spill it with cunning and, above all, understand well why we spill it and get the viewer to understand that reason as well.

Don't get me wrong «Parasites» is not a bloody drama, but a beautiful film that with humor and gravity touches the three classic themes of art: it is a tragicomedy about love, life and death, it is a film about the joy of living, about survival, about the family of the 21st century, but not like the concept of family defined and defended by many, that sick, stifled definition, confined to religious dogmas and eulogistic of expired and obsolete values. It is about real and living families of the planet in 2019, many dispossessed and a few privileged, in a game of services and currency exchanges, in the last days of capitalism with its agenda of violence, horror and death.

Although director Bong Joon-ho has already made about ten feature films of various themes, I only know one of his films, the cult fable «The Guest», a horrific science fiction tale about the relationships within a poor and dysfunctional family of Seoul, that is put in check when a monster generated by the toxins thrown into the Han River by an American scientist, kidnaps a young member of that family nucleus. Again, in «Parasite», Bong addresses the family issue, opposing a poor family made up of the parents and two children, to a rich family with the same number of members. The moment they cross roads is the basis of the story. A third component, personified by a housekeeper, gives an unexpected twist to the story and leads to the violent climax, which is not the end of the fascinating story; at this point of the story, it still has another 15 minutes of history to tell, until the sad final close-up that ends this work.

When I watch films like ""Parasites"" my heart skips a beat, I wish that people would have access to a wide and cultured film offer, that we all could see works like this instead of consuming the despicable L.A. garbage that the cinemas offer, week after week, freezing the reasoning of people from the whole world; or having to wait for an exclusive film festival to project them fleetingly, and to be subject to serials of thrones and other lousy dishes. As soon as «Parasite» appears through any of the windows we have today to watch movies, don't miss it.","Dec 5, 2019"
10,"Kim family vs Park family, and then...","At the beginning of this movie we watch the Kim family struggle to survive in our modern and advanced society. Yes, I am being sarcastic. That's all I have left when talking about a society where the hardship of extreme poverty is often contrasted with the excesses of extreme wealth. You might argue that without such problems in our society we wouldn't have so much material to work with and create such wonderful stories as the one depicted in Parasites. Good point, but I will get back to this at the end of my review.

The Kim family's struggle to survive is wonderfully illustrated with a perfect balance between funny and sad. We often feel like laughing but then, strangely enough, we also feel like we shouldn't. Something that will quickly become obvious is the connection between the members of the Kim family. They are acting as a tight unit. One might think that's normal since people usually unite against a common enemy, in this case, poverty. But it is also true that this is a family, not just a group of poor people. They care about each other. Anyway, coming back to the plot, they will interact with the rich Park family and that's all I think I should tell you. How they will do it, what will happen as a consequence is a complex plot which moves like a rise to the top of a mountain, followed by a rapid descent once we passed the peak. You will know immediately when that happens. This moment, obvious to me, was nevertheless striking and masterfully done.

As my step-daughter brought to my attention, no one is the main character, all the main characters, all 10 of them, are important, and extremely well acted. Music is used parsimoniously and judiciously as a counterpoint to accelerated sequences which help keep the plot flowing smoothly, and therefore, avoids dead times. The camera work, although sometimes creative, is most often straight to the point. It shows us the situation and wastes no time on useless but beautiful imagery. In other words, every shot counts.

This movie, while telling us an interesting story, is also a social statement. And, as I indicated at the beginning of this review, I see this as a great illustration of the consequences of living in a sick society. Sure, it is nothing new, but it brings to mind many questions. The most important to me: do we, as a species who is supposed to be intelligent, continue in the current direction, and continue to make interesting stories, or do we stop, clean up our act, and create only fantasy stories in worlds which are not our own? Note how the Kim family is actually pretty smart and resourceful. And yet, they are poor. Yeah s. it happens, and more often than not, just because of the way our society works, or rather, doesn't.","Nov 10, 2019"
10,A review from a non Bong Joon-Ho fan.,"I have seen every film he has made other than his first film. I liked them all but felt all of them were overrated other than Memories of Murder. I felt that second film of his was his best until Parasite . I loved every frame of this film. And such a creative plot. This is easily my favorite non American film in years. It is the kind of film that you see with a friend or your partner and want to discuss for hours. It is not a film I really want to discuss too much.The less you know the better. The purpose of this review is to tell people that have felt the same way about Bong Joon-Ho as I have in the past, that this time all the accolades are deserved. This is a true masterpiece that will be studied for years to come in film classes all over the world.","Nov 5, 2019"
9,too much great,"This movie has 2 parts, the first one a kind of comedy, but too much smart, and the second is a complete tragedy, This year the Oscar Awrd is very interesting, there are wonderful movies and Parasite is one of them","Jan 19, 2020"
9,What's the real grift,"This film is always one step ahead of its audience. You are so in tune with the protagonists that by the time they are neck deep into their futile grift, the question of who's right or who's wrong isn't so much as being poised by the master director Bong Joon-ho; it's being slammed over your head with a rock. And when you recover, and the audience claps, the answer still isn't clear.

Parasite is deserving of all the massive praise it has received. That I saw this in a packed theater with an adoring, fully rapt crowd truly warmed my heart. It's cinema at its best.

As many folks are noting, and I will reiterate: go into this cold! Read as little about it as possible if you can. It will make the experience so much better. This is one I know I will be revisiting often over the years. Enjoy it.","Jan 13, 2020"

Not only is this a uniquely mesmerising story, told through brilliant acting and magical cinematography, it is also dripping with metaphor and symbolism.

9,"Clever plot that twist with a surprise call it good verus bad, rich against poor, overall great film!","Director Bong Joon-Ho really did it with his latest picture ""Parasite"" as it is one entertaining dark suspense drama that is revealing as the plot twist with a surprise which brings change for all of the characters. Despite reading subtitles the film is thrilling and entertaining as it involves the poor Ki-taek family who have a young boy and girl who become tutors to the kids of the wealthy Park family only a scheme really lies underneath it all only an incident happens and a discovery changes the game for all, still the Ki-taek family is stubborn and proud as they will do anything to survive. Overall good take and spin on class that's supported by shrewdness, suspense, intrigue, drama, and pumping black heart like comedy. ""Parasite"" by far by the way it entertains and grabs you was one of 2019's best films.","Jan 21, 2020"
9,A WONDERFUL PIECE OF CINEMA!,"Parasite is one of the few movies that live up to the hype around them. Getting all the praise in the world from audiences and critics alike, it's being called the movie of the decade. On top of this, it has won 4 Oscars including Best Picture. But I assume you already knew that, in which case I apologize for wasting your time. But if the hype and those Oscars aren't enough to convince you to watch this then maybe reading on further will.

Parasite doesn't stick to a single genre but is a mix of drama, comedy, satire, mystery and suspense. All this fit into a 2 hour movie without causing a hitch in the seamless transitions between those genres. Fueled with incredible performances from each and every cast member, the movie ,despite being a thriller, involves a plot which is so believable, that it's frightening.

Wildly unpredictable, the title of the movie will only make sense after the ending and till then, you'll only be left guessing. Not revealing the details, but the movie seems to be going in a certain direction at which point it takes a sharp turn into complete madness. Things pretty much escalate from there, revealing a clearer picture about the intention of the movie.

The more praiseworthy thing apart from the flawless camera work and near perfect direction, is the display of the disparity between the rich and poor using symbolism and other It paints a picture about what it's like to be on both sides without the presence of any heroes or villains.

I personally think that movies have become such an inherent part of our lives and their global presence has at least touched if not influenced a lot of people. And not using such a powerful, widespread medium to communicate about a social cause ( of which we have plenty) seems like a wasted opportunity. So kudos to director Bong Joon-ho for taking on this issue and yet finding a way to make it entertaining!","Apr 5, 2020"

9,Definitely one of my favourite movies,"I usually don't watch Korean movies, but the hype has insisted that I delve into it. And I have to say, I don't regret it one bit. The cinematography, the secret hidden messages in many scenes, the eerieness yet explosive plot-twists- perhaps I live under a rock, but it's rare to find a plot remotely similar to this, at least in my experience. It was truly an interesting and exceptional movie. Almost a mind game, it's fun to catch what you've missed on the rewatch. Jammed packed with thriller and drama.","Jul 5, 2021"
9,It's clearly a 10/10,"Masterpiece, no cgi, no Michael Bay, extraordinary story, social critical. It'll make you think about your position as a viewer of the movie in a cinema, after you've watched it. 10/10 + Oscar","Nov 5, 2019"

9,Parasite (2019),"Director Bong Joon-ho's global sensation, Parasite, is an allegorical tale of class warfare. Before watching the film, I was familiar with its high praise but knew little of its actual plot. If possible, I'd recommend other viewers similarly go into this one as cold as they can. While Parasite deals with heavy themes (economic mobility, climate change), it does so in ways that are constantly entertaining and surprising. A unique blend of drama, suspense, comedy, and horror, Parasite provides further proof that cinema is a truly universal language.","Feb 9, 2020"

9,"Parasite is a tragic, thrilling film from a brilliant director.",This movie is excellent and unique. The entirety of the film is like a puzzle that fits perfectly. This movie is intense and exciting. A perfectly crafted lie that is created too hastily and greedily and ruined just as quickly. The bigger they are the harder they fall and the path to success has no shortcuts.,"May 8, 2020"
9,One of my favorite live-action Japanese movies.,"This is one of my favorite movies of the year. The wonderful director is back at ít again with another Korean film. And this film is certainly up to his standards.

First, I'm gonna go mention everything good about this movie.

The cinematography is beautiful. The colors look mesmerizing throughout the whole runtime. They manage to make even simple dialogue scenes interesting with complex camera movements and angles. The color palette perfectly matches the moods of the scenes.

The acting is mostly pretty good from all actors involved. The dialogue and characters are well-written, memorable and compelling. It's extremely well-directed. The locations feel realistic and like their a character.

The suspenseful scenes are well-made and executed. They're suspenseful and you sit on the edge of your seat. The montages where multiple are happening are well-edited. You know what's going on since it's been recently established. The editing is fun and fresh.

It manages to both thrilling, scary and funny without any of them ruining the others. The suspenseful parts are suspenseful, and the comedy is placed at inappropriate parts. The music choices and score match the scenes they're in perfectly and they never feel out of place.

The scary parts are well-executed and photographed and they're genuinely suspenseful. It never felt forced or misplaced. There is, of course, no comedy randomly placed in the middle of a tense scene like there is in most modern-day movies.

I don't think there is a single thing about this movie I dislike. It is by far my favorite movie of the year. This is a movie everyone would enjoy. I don't think there's a single person I wouldn't recommend this to.","Oct 9, 2019"
9,A very compelling story.,"Brilliant, deep, and leaves you on the edge of your seat! From comedy to horror to drama, I never thought a movie with subtitles could get me hooked like this one! Hopefully this is the spark that brings non-English cinema back into the limelight of popular film in the United States, instead of being limited to arthouse exposure exclusively.","Jul 7, 2020"
9,BEST MOVIE,I love how everything changes in this film. I won't spoil anything from parasites because everyone has to see it. The way the poor family infiltrates the big but still vulnerable family is fantastic. The spectacle is great and the plot twist in the middle and at the end is just one word to describe WOW,"Mar 26, 2020"
9,Amazing! What a rollercoaster! Definitely recommend.,"Clever and darkly humorous, 'Parasite' is Bong Joon-ho all the way through, and he gives us a masterclass in writing and directing. With its superb visuals that are full of metaphorical shots and an incredibly talented cast, the film delivers a captivating commentary on the stark contrast between rich and poor - those who are destined to rule and those who are destined to serve; how being one or the other defines who you are, and the lengths that the latter is willing to go to when striving to change that. Whether you agree entirely with the iconic director's bleak outlook doesn't affect how fantastic of a viewing experience his latest work is.","May 25, 2020"
9,Brilliant !!!,"One of the best movies I've seen in a while. As soon as I learned it was from the same director Snowpiercer, I knew I had to watch it. Plot twists, great story telling, and stunning visuals are just a few reasons I enjoyed this film so much.","May 8, 2020"
9,Modern Day Metropolis,"This is a must see film packed with tons of implied meaning tackling many social issues focussing on the wealth gap. However the implied message behind the movie is also matching with a complex base level story which surprises the audience with every passing moment. No I know that many people are turned off at the sight of subtitles, but I hope that if this is the only factor keeping you from watching this movie, I beg you to overlook it and enjoy this incredible cinematic experience.

I think that this movie has a really unique way of showing the gaps between the social classes that exist. I find that just like Metropolis there are several consistencies between the two, but at the base of this there is one single theme; The rich despite relying on the working class often take advantage of them. Now this movie may have gone to the extreme showing how some people just can't take the oppression and they eventually crack but I think that it was important for the filmmaker to show how social conditions set up the downtrodden to fail.

I absolutely loved how this movie developed and found myself watching it three times in a row ad each time I discovered a new feeling for the film. So that being said I gave this movie a 9/10 because I think that with every viewing there is more to take away from this film.","Nov 26, 2019"

9,Surprisingly creepy and smart,"This is the first subbed movie I have watched in awhile and was easier to follow than I remembered.

This movie is filled with unexpected and surprisingly simple techniques that will keep you guessing. Though the plot is not very complex, it's interesting and flows well. A few surprises were present in the movie and makes you stop and rethink what is actually going on.

Acting is spot on in all aspects and part of the joy of this movie.

9,Really Good Movie!,"I thought was it was one of the best films for 2019. Story was a little confusing. It involves two families: one poor, one rich. The poor family does everything they can to ingratiate themselves into the rich family's lives. They get caught up in a web of lies, starting their own lies with their employment with the family.

The movie's plot was a little misleading. You thought it was going to start off as a family comedy heist. Later on the movie starts to take a darker, more sinister turn.

Overall, movie was spectacular. The acting was phenomenal. The cinematography was breathtaking.

Wouldn't give the movie all 10 stars because of the plot but, would definitely recommend to Korean film fans.","Nov 4, 2019"
9,"Great film, great filmmaker.","I've loved every film of Bong Joon Ho's that I've scene dating back to the Host. One of the premier auteurs of our generation. This film did what so few films do in our current era, it genuinely surprised. The film is as authentically original and inspired as people are saying it is.

Loved it.","Feb 5, 2020"
9,Don't Leave the Window Open,"Life in the dregs is unpleasant. One must learn, adapt, and get their hands dirty just to maintain life's basic necessities. All the while one must cope with the knowledge that there are those that will look down on you because of circumstances that, whether deserved or undeserved, can chip away at ones spirit.

All societies have their strata, and one method of survival at the bottom of the rung is to cling to those at the top. Such relationship can be mutual, but it can also be parasitic. I assume anyone reading this can guess the kind that forms the base of this movie.

Director Bong Joon Ho does not need me to sing his praises, but I will say this, Memories of Murder is one of my favorite films of all time. He has created a host of other good films as well (see what I did there) and Parasite is no different. His direction is a compelling and methodical dissection of two worlds. One if for the poor where they live surrounded by concrete and wire, and below peeing drunkards. The other is a beautiful triumph of architecture surrounded by trees and sunshine, a house worthy of a success.

Parasite was a roller coaster of a watch that never lingered. Keeping the viewer engaged, the movie shifts tone at various points, and the direction never misses a step. As the two worlds collide, thanks to the machinations of the downtrodden, I was kept of the edge of my seat not quite able to sense what was coming next. Accented by some fantastically comical scenes towards the beginning, the movie manages to maintain a sinister tone. Performances blend into scenes as characters playing other characters dance around and play off each other seamlessly. It feels grimy and unsettling to watch, both because of the conditions the poor are subject to, but also at the levels they will stoop to. There is something violative about watching a family's intimate space be invaded. The forecast does not look bright for any party involved.

The picture painted here is detailed and rich, and full of superb performances, especially from the youngest members of the poor family. As for criticisms, I have very little. Did I love it as much as Memories of Murder? No, but that is more a result of this film, while feeling extremely relevant in this day and age, hitting on a tone that has been explored to high heaven before, the haves vs. the have not. That is not to say Parasite has nothing new to say, although that case can be made, it just lacks a certain kind of rawness.

That being said, Parasite weaves through its plot with frighteningly good execution. Through all the twists and turns we the viewer witness how one's class can sticks to them like a smell, unyielding and betraying any façade they put on. Sometimes you have to get dirty before you can get clean. And then sometimes people just never quite find a way to fit into their circumstances. There is much here to like and I recommend it wholeheartedly.","Nov 24, 2019"
9,Relatively Amazing,"If you want a thought-provoking movie that will stick with you for hours (or days), then Parasite is the movie for you. Most movies have a clear division between the protagonist and antagonist. You root for one and despise the other, because that's what we've been groomed to do for our entire lives - but what if the divide weren't so clear? Classism is an age-old separation that has been symbolized in literature and television for years and years. The ""good guy"" is wealthy, and the ""bad guy"" is poor, or vice versa. That isn't always how it works in real life, and Parasite strives to exemplify that.

I would be gravely mistaken if I didn't mention the phenomenal acting and breathtaking cinematography that takes place in Parasite. The tension that begins to build about halfway through the movie is palatable, and will make your stomach knot. I recommend going into this movie with no spoilers and very little prior knowledge of the film, as it'll make the experience that much better.

I've seen a lot of 3-7 star reviews claiming that they don't ""get the film"", and that it is over-hyped. You need to be able to look past the superficial to understand this film. Good and bad are obsolete, and classist stereotypes are shattered into pieces. Go into this film with an open mind and an agreement to think past what you see on the screen. There is a lot of symbolism and reading between the lines in this film, and to fully understand it, you'll need a good hour to think after the film. As you're laying in bed, wondering what the hell you just saw on screen, it'll all start piecing together in your brain. That's what makes a good film, and Parasite is one of the best I've seen this year.","Aug 9, 2020"
9,Still in shock,What and how and why and when that is the questions you gonna ask at the end,"Feb 23, 2020"
9,A cruel allegory for the truth of society,"At the beginning of the close to the real life segment, is a very common introduction technique in Korean films. The long, slow shot passes through the cramped living space on the ground floor, and the characters are drawn one by one. In the cluttered and narrow semi-basement, the plot of searching for network signals and pizza boxes soon leads the viewer smoothly into the narrative atmosphere of life. The combination of deliberate camera speed and quick message delivery is so precise that it has proven the power of director bong joon-ho.



When stepping into the mansion that moment, ""parasites"" and the real story gradually away, but into the structure and framework of social fable. That doesn't mean the director has given up on story and suspense, though. It's certainly not the freehand brushwork of burning, which won critical acclaim last year but lost popularity, but it's similar to the metaphors and hints in snowpiercingly, and even to the themes of class and destiny. An undetected basement, like that set by many science fiction works, becomes a space device that isolates the class and tests humanity.



The passage about family education can naturally get heated discussion from domestic audiences who are in the middle of anxiety. The depiction of high-asset families in the film is a kind of deliberate label misreading, which makes all members look silly and indifferent, which is obviously not true. But the director quickly deflects the viewer's confusion with exquisite technical expertise. First of all, the suspense and conflict in the script are constantly pushed forward, which makes the audience hardly pay attention to the serious injury in the life picture, which also becomes an important evidence to question its commercial genre. But I have to admit that this is the subtlety of the script, every character has realized their own appearance, deduction, transformation and account, every props given to the camera, whether stone, secret door, tea table or induction lamp, have been effectively used, become an important force to promote the story.



What is exquisite is the scene itself. The three important locations of poor families, rich people's villas and underground secret rooms are all arranged in a very real and rich way. The seemingly random close-ups can accurately present the emotions of each scene and the differences between each other. The stylization of the scene also serves as a metaphor for the theme, just like the ""strange smell"" that the host keeps saying, which is the smell of poverty and the significant difference of different living conditions. It brings out the heart of separation hidden under the surface of kindness, builds up estrangement and hatred, and finally promotes the explosion of the ending.



Of course, technical sophistication was not enough to get the jury's approval. The emotional tension at the heart of the film comes from the characters' examination of their own lives, from the warmth and kindness that cannot dissolve the estrangement, from the tears in the eyes of a poor father as he looks back at his home in the flood, and from the tragic conflict facing the family of four after a brief period of joy. The film also jumped out of the suspense genre, with some depth to cause thinking. The mislabeling of the high class is also highlighted in these passages, which is an unavoidable wound in the film.



But like snow train, bong joon-ho has always been reluctant to disrupt the plot with lyricism and pauses. This preserves the tension and integrity of the story, but it can also hurt the meaning and attitude that the fable itself hopes to convey.



Butler's rainy night visit to the line and joy and sadness both before and after contrast so bright, even fantasy is over the boy out of the warmth of the segment, the film to be presented by the split, opposition and despair has carefully through setting suspense infiltrated the viewer's heart, it's almost no moralizing paragraph, but through the story of extremes, is like a knife cut the surface of society, will be more deep vein and the body.



When the story is over, who lives in a dark room and who travels in the sun like an insect, everyone may have found the answer. The reflection and emotion gained from the fable can also provide richer support for the following life choices.","Dec 21, 2019"

9,One of the best script ever!,"It starts as a high quality comedy movie but things getting change. General look at Parasite, it's true to say that it's kind of horror movie couse' of the main idea. People like Kim family, lives in the real world society and doing ""parasiting"" to other people. This is one of the best movies in 2019 and director's best work after Snowpiercer.","Jan 24, 2020"
9,Multilayered portrayal of the real Korea,"This is a movie about a class struggle in South Korea, like what movie ""Us"" attempts to do but done properly. It is a stark reminder of what true living standards for most South Koreans look like, and its realism is very painful. Few are aware of the fact that up to the 1980s, South Korea was in fact more impoverished than North Korea, and it was only late that the situation reversed with famines of the 90s etc, but many people still live miserable lives, and situation is very similar to that in China, where a few got gloriously rich but the urban masses still live in bug infested cheap dwellings.

Some crafty members of this underclass manage to con contemptuous rich man into employing them as his servants. For many Asians smell is a way to express utter contempt, and this is often directed against the white people, who, being able to process milk, smell ""like butter"" and are seen in rac ist light as unclean, but the same rac ist contempt is directed towards the poor. The poor accept these valuations and fight for the crumbles, like roaches in the dark, but in life and death situations, resentment might boil up and the contempt might cost the rich their empty heads.

The movie paints a sad picture of modern East Asian societies, with many subtle points, criticizes their culture and emulation of the America, with a few cruel but precise strokes. The sheer talent of the Korean filmmaker, but also the fact that West likes movies from foreign countries that are self bashing, allowing the worst condescension rooted in colonialism that failed miserably in East Asia to thrive, one more reason to cheer this slightly overrated movie.","Jan 16, 2020"

9,An Instant Classic,"Parasite directed by Bong Joon Ho has become instantly ingrained into film culture already. It became the first foreign film to win best picture and for good reason. Parasite is one of the most original movies I've seen in a long time. From the jaw dropping suspense, to the social commentary, the one word I have for this movie is meticulous. The film follows the poor Kim family as they hatch a scheme to infiltrate the very wealthy Park family. The concept is simple enough, but the story both subverts and exceeds your expectations as the plot snowballs out of control. The movie is a showcase at building suspense. As the movie goes on the tension grows higher and higher until we get the payoff in the climax. The movie's script is just so great! The characters are written profoundly and every scene means something to all the characters, the themes and the story. The cinematography in this is also really great. Another thing that really stands out is the messaging and how it is conveyed. The audience is treated with the upmost respect from director Bong Joon Ho as he never is heavy handed delivering this social theme. The theme is conveyed is symbolism and metaphors and it works amazingly. I really loved Parasite and it is probably a close second for my favorite movie of the year after The Irishman. It is definitely somewhere in my top 15 favorite movies of the decade if not too 10. The movie is extremely creative, original, and meticulously created. I'm happy to say that Parasite stands amongst some of the greatest foreign films ever made. 9.5/10","Jun 21, 2020"

9,Masterpiece,The powerful plot throws up some brilliant twists that could never have been guessed upon. Parasite clearly portrayed what class division in a society. A brilliant masterpiece that deserves to be watched and felt upon!! Highly recommended if you like korean movies.,"Feb 16, 2020"
9,A Movie about differences between different class in our society and climate change,"South Korean filmmaker Bong Joon-ho already has an impeccable track record, but he's stepped up his game with this brilliant, powerfully revealing social satire. Certainly Parasite might feel uneven to some audiences because of its radical shifts in tone -- from clever comedy to violent, dark tragedy -- but it's more likely that Bong has executed everything as planned. Each insignificant detail, from the young boy Da-song's love of Native Americans to a peach allergy to the Kim family's sad little half-basement apartment, has been planted for some specific, exacting reason.

Cleanly and slickly constructed, Parasite takes perverse pleasure in scamming the rich during its leisurely, funny first half, and that pleasure is contagious. When the second half comes, it's not only a narrative shock, but it also forces viewers to ask hard questions about why the first half was so enjoyable. In earlier films Bong slyly explored the impact that humans have had on our environment. In Parasite, he looks at an even bigger picture. He wonders why humans tend to look away from, or insulate themselves from, others' troubles and suffering. In this movie, reaching the high ground is certainly desirable, but those occupying the low ground aren't going anywhere.","May 2, 2020"
9,Unconventional and terrific,"The Academy Awards are in 5 days and Parasite is nominated for 6 Oscars, including best picture. I thought that the most simple comparison to make is between this and Once Upon a Time in Hollywood. Both films are entertaining throughout the entire run-time, but really blast off in a bizarre fashion in the final minutes. Parasite is at its best when it uses haunting imagery and compelling character relationships to drive the plot forward. This is one to root for at the awards.","Feb 5, 2020"

But man I did not expect the direction this movie takes at many moments. I found myself jaw dropping, laughing and over all just adoring the choises that were made during the production of this masterpiece.","Dec 24, 2019"

This films have gotten everything to keep you hooked! For me, this film has all the basic of cinema and Bong have really mastered it.","Jun 3, 2022"
9,An excellent movie that you won't be able to stop thinking about,"Great movies often stay with me long after I watch them. Parasite is a great movie and one that I found myself thinking about over and over, days after I watched it in the cinema. For those that haven't seen it, it's very hard to describe what sort of movie this is. Part heist, part thriller, very 'Hitchcockian', it's incredibly tense and often very funny. It's amazing how invested you can be in a film with no clear 'good or bad guys', no one in this film is a hero.

Parasite is laden with social commentary, some subtle and some not so! At times it walks the line between believable and unbelievable and will have you questioning every characters morales at one point or another. It is perfectly paced and wonderfully shot. I didn't love the very end, that's not to say I didn't get the message it was portraying, I just didn't think it was quite up to the standard of the rest of the film. I don't want to include any spoilers though and the beauty of this film is that everyone will draw their opinion.

9.3/10 - I'm looking forward to watching it again sometime!","May 13, 2020"
9,South Korean cinema taken to the highest level.,"Parasite is everything you didn't expected it to be. Any advice? Don't take any spoilers and allow yourself to be surprised, and you will be every minute. Bong Jun Ho's film is humoured, ironic, fun, scary and effortlessly touching. The social side of the movie might seem very subtle, but it's everywhere. There aren't many metaphors to make it seem bigger, everything is neat and effective. This is the kind of movie you didn't expect to come from South Korea, but maybe it's this great because it is from South Korea.","Nov 11, 2019"
9,This was a very interesting movie,"It's weird how a movie can be so disturbing yet so hilarious at the same time, as well as a lot of gruesome moments towards the end. The acting was excellent and the scenes were not predictable which is what made it very intriguing. Not going to lie, my heart was racing in some of the scenes. 100% recommend watching this movie, truly a masterpiece.","Dec 8, 2020"
9,The best movie I have seen years,"I am bored from standard and cliché movies. This movie is very different and original. It is entertaining throughout, has a few twists and the story is great. The movie makes you think throughout and at the end. It is funny at times but serious watch. Well worth all the oscars.","Oct 27, 2020"
9,A unique and unpredictable feature film from one of the world's most exciting directors,"Over the course of well-regarded and unique films such as The Host, the under-appreciated Snowpiercer and the crazy Netflix distributed Okja, Korean filmmaker Bong Joon Ho has established himself as one of the most noteworthy foreign directors of the last few decades.

Following on with his ability to mix and match genres with an ever-present dark vein of humor seeping through his narratives veins, Ho has hit it big with the surprise 2019 hit Parasite, that now sits pretty in the IMDB Top 50 films of all-time and stands head and shoulders above other foreign films from 2019 in regards to box-office takings off a small scale budget of a couple of million dollars.

Incomparable to any other film you could think of, Parasite is a very original beast, that believe it or not combines drama, comedy, thriller and even moments of horror to ensure that its many twists and turns and social commentary co-inhabit to create an entirely unpredictable experience that is best watched with as little pre-understanding as possible.

Centered around the below the poverty line Kim family and their new employment in the household of the wealthy Park family, Parasite allows Ho to weave together a loaded plot-line that may seemingly be headed one way, only to surprise us all as it veers further and further away from the expected.

Wonderfully played out by its core cast, with highlights from Kang-ho Song as father Ki-taek and Hye-jin Jang as mother Chung-sook, Parasite is the type of unnerving film that keeps you mentally on edge throughout as you're glued to the screen, unable to turn away from a disaster in the making that must surely be headed towards a finale as wild as we would expect from a director like Ho.

As you watch the expertly directed, edited and scored film, one that has you laughing one minute and gasping for air the next, you begin to appreciate that you're watching a director operating at the top of their game, in what's still likely a career only around its halfway mark, it's exciting to think of where Ho and his inventive mind can go in the future as he continues to give us films that seem to be cut entirely from their own cloths.

In an age where many films are nothing but pale imitations, remakes or sequels, its exciting to see efforts such as Parasite that give us something new, fresh and exhilarating, no doubt a reason why the word of mouth from cinema-goers helped make Parasite a world-wide smash hit and a genuine Best Picture contender at the upcoming Oscars.

Final Say -

While not flawless, Parasite isn't far off it, a darkly observed social commentary piece that is both heartbreaking and brilliantly humorous, Bong Joon Ho has further established himself as one of the in-form directors working today with what could well be his most important film yet.

South Korean movies have been well received for some time now, and this one is no exception.

Nothing should be added, nothing should be removed, its amazing as it is.

Its terrifying, horrible, sad, eerie, scary, funny and gloomy.

Acting is very good, and so are the costumes and scenery.

I will never look at peaches the same way after watching this movie.

I loved the wifi situation, and their solution to the problem, and the way the father was so proud of his daughter, being able to falsify.

9,From poverty to total madness,"This film has deservedly been nominated for awards this season. It is shocking how the director presents the differences between social strata. Shades the characters. There is nothing good or bad in this movie. People are the actors. Mortal, simple ordinary people. The film cannot be classified in a single genre. Sometimes drama or comedy. Towards the end, it taps into a thriller. Displaying rich people is pretty simple. They have no problems. Unlike poorer people. Filming the film is brilliant. The film operates with very strong images. The atmosphere is breathtaking. The movie hangs in front of the screen all the way. The turns are screwed. They ignore the clichés. Simply put, this film has been well-deserved because it raises and answers social questions that are very serious today.","Apr 28, 2020"
9,Recently the BEST MOVIE!,"Technically the movie sector is a way of entertainment, and Parasite is a really good example for it. The film has everything! Thrilling adventure, a family drama, dark humor and twisting scenes. In the middle of the movie everything twists and chains you in your chair. Joon-ho Bong put up a really good job. Directed really good. The casting was really good, with the well-played actings and good directing the characters reflected their emotional conditions very good. The one con i can point out about the film is the slightly weak ending. It could've been more emotional, tragedian and exiting. Over all its a really fun movie to watch, infect the best one recently. These kind of movies don't come often.","Oct 2, 2019"
9,Tremendous Achievement for the Oscars,"Looking back at the previous Best Picture winner, which was literally one month before the corona pandemic, it's still remarkable that the South Korean black comedy thriller film Parasite even won such a prestigious award in the first place. Marked as the return of Snowpiercer & Okja director Bong Joon-ho in his native country, the film gained international recognition for being the first South Korean film to win the Palme d'Or at Cannes, and for being one of the highest rated films in recent years. So now that's been a year since its historical landmark, it's time to see if the movie's status is actually worthy of all the praise.

The film follows the poor Kim family who start off scheming to achieve employment from the wealthy Park family and end up infiltrating their household by disguising as separate highly qualified individuals. That alone is all that can be stated about the movie without detailing too many narrative points, for as seemingly simple of a premise as this is, the whole movie goes in so many different directions. The first third establishes the state of low income poverty the Kim family is in, therefore making their desire to make money off of the upper class. From then on, the film becomes part commentary of the rich being infiltrated by the poor. As Bong Joon-ho himself stated, the film's title is derived from how the rich will end up leeching off the poor and how the poor may potentially take advantage of their positions. The Kim family themselves are so charismatic, especially the intelligent son Kim Ki-woo and the witty sardonic father Kim Ki-taek, that even if you didn't know they were a whole unit, you would buy them as their individual personas and be none the wiser at all.

However, from the movie's second act onward, the plot ends up becoming a lot more complicated than your average liar revealed story. While seemingly darker and more messed up than the film's initial comedic tone, it does paint a thoroughly fascinating picture of what might happen if the ultra aristocratic landscape sucked the less fortunate in with it. Given the major theme of class warfare that is explored throughout the feature, one can imagine how passionate Bong and co-writer Han Jin-won are towards the subject matter, yet clearly not entirely one sided, as they do portray poor sides as legitimate people of different circumstances. The Park family are likable in their general concern and safety of their own children, in addition to their home, except that they happen to be unaware of how their own privileged well being may affect others. However, their own obliviousness to what goes on with the Kim family ends up adding into the film's themes of the social economic gap hurting some and benefiting others. The ones below have to suffer while the ones above get to have all the fun.

Now given that the film is part comedy and part thriller, the pacing does actually make the shift between each scene rather poignant. Given how differently the Kims and Parks live, with one living in a murky semi-basement apartment around a low income town and the other living in a higher class fancy house with a gorgeous forest, the film knows how to convey a realistic amount of sardonic humor and horrific pathos based on what goes down in their lives. The gritty yet down to earth cinematography by Hong Kyung-pyo and subtly jarring music by Jung Jae-il also play big parts in the intentional tonal shifts, with a lot of high tension coming after things seem a little good for the Kims or a little too bad for the Parks. Also, given that most of the production design was actually built from the ground up instead of the crew using already existing architecture, the film's themes of how real estate is generally utilized end up giving more character to the poor and rich sides of Seoul. I guess if you're going to play around with sets, they need to be your own.

There are few movies that depict the economical segregation between classes as surreally profound as Parasite, and that's what truly makes it worthy of its Best Picture victory. Even if there are other incredible foreign language films that have tackled these issues in their own ways, it's not often when they get as much attention as this one, although I'm sure there are plenty of great ones on this movie's level too. So if you're yet to see the film and you're curious as to why it's been immensely well received, give it a go yourself. It sure is one heck of a thrill for anyone regardless of their class.","May 18, 2021"
9,Fantastic !,"This film is really good and makes you think deeply about the situations it shows. The duality between the protagonist family and the rich Park's is shown in such a wonderful, realistic manner. This type of storytelling has been long missing and I hope more movie makers follow in this trend - in their own original way of course.

My one complaint was that the film is slow in some middle parts; some scenes last longer than they should. This could be a cultural difference in film-making, as another South Korean film I watched had these instances as well. Still, it's not enough for me to completely give up on it. It's a proper thriller, American films have tried to pull this off throughout the whole of last decade, but failed (with the exception of ""Get Out."") You laugh, you're sent to the edge of your seat, you get angry, and finally you feel sad. You know a movie is great when it's able to awaken so many emotions and leave you talking about different interpretations of the film long after you've watched it.

I'm glad South Korean films are getting the attention they deserve. I've watched other South Korean films in the past and they are excellent storytellers. Congratulations to everyone involved with this film, you all did an amazing job and I'm happy your hard work has been recognized on an international level.

Highly recommend this film and if you're avoiding it due to subtitles or the non-sensible bad reviews, you're sorely missing out.","Jan 27, 2020"
9,Wicked,"Dark comedy with a very natural plot. Somehow all the fraud shown could happen in real life. What gets me is my culture has certain similarity with Korean, perhaps it is asian curse. Actors are so deep in their roles. And well done directed. I even could sense the body scent issue, frowned at the social gap, the misery of faking our real life for others in the name of greater good. God, I laughed and swore at same time. 100% recommend this movie to all my friends.","Aug 21, 2019"
9,Comedic and Suspenseful,"I can't believe some people were complaining about having to watch with subtitles, they're missing out. We first get to know the two families at the start of film and as time passes, we wonder how long this relationship is going to last. This movie portrays the struggles the poor face and the obliviousness of the wealthy. At the same time, it manages to make us feel sorry for both of these families despite their class differences. Overall, great film to watch with the many perspectives and symbolism.","Feb 9, 2021"
9,Great Thriller,"This film is amazing. Mixes elements of comedy, suspense, and drama in a beautiful manner. I forgot I was reading subtitles after the film, as I was so engaged during the screening.

Hmm yes it is, what i liked most directing and screen play is no doubt amazing especially the script that doesn't lose it's value the original script that doesn't fill any senseless scenes of the movie and doesn't leave any real plot holes, showing the prespective from three different familys having an exciting, emotional, and unexpected series of events from the three sides, surprising ending delivers the plot twist but what i was expecting from what i heard never reached the shocking moment that i was waiting for something much more than what itself is but it just delivers the conclusion of the sensitive story an ending with a point that leaves the viewer with sad feelings, wonderful scenes so much detail is given to every scenes, if you like drama you will truly enjoy this it will always be top in my recommendation for drama category, every aspect of it is given the performance of a premium movie, highly recommended for drama fans, 9/10⭐","Feb 28, 2020"
9,A social comedy switch over a crazy thriller black comedy,"A family with few resources, mother, father, son and daughter live in a sordid basement in a poor neighbourhood in Seoul. They don´t have a permanent job, they survive by doing temporary employment, nor can they pay for the necessary studies so that children can progress in the workplace. Thanks to a university friend, the son will be able to give private lessons to the newly adolescent of a rich family living in a large house, in which the whole family will gradually be placed. A relaxed night of fun in the absence of the owners will become, under an intense downpour and surprising discoveries, into a stressful nightmare, and from this kind social comedy a crazy thriller will be born that will mutate into black comedy.

It has a very good narrative rhythm, it is a constant ascension of a ""harder still"" that surprises you at each inflection, and when it reaches its zenith you are already wondering what small mistake they will make that will cause everything to be discovered or, what new impersonation they will be imagining and thus, absolute chaos will arrive in a thrilling way that will leave you breathless. It's how to ride a roller coaster! The thing does not end here, there is a conclusion narrated in the first person by the protagonist that seems to leave everything clear, where both surprises and new dreams emerge. Bright, very bright!

Everything fits perfectly, the two families seem real, and the actors do an excellent job, all of them, the comparison between the two houses is dazzling, the script is brilliant and has a good photograph director and a very good director. A film that no one who likes cinema can miss or who is minimally interested in the current social trends can miss it.

I am like many Americans that tend to avoid movies that are not in English. I feel like I'm missing visual aspects of the performance, and miss out on relevant inflections and nuances in speech patterns because I can't connect the words being spoken with the meaning of the words.

With such good reviews I said screw it! No more will I limit myself to just American cinema and it paid off. Now I have a bunch of foreign films lined up to watch. I highly recommend seeing this, and if your like me with the subtitles just give it chance you wont regret this one.","Feb 22, 2020"
9,"Parasite Review: Comedy, drama, suspense, and yes, even horror.","A family who doesn't have a lot of money or opportunities in life, starts working for a wealthy family. But will this change the life of the poor family?

DIRECTOR: Bong Joon Ho SCREENWRITERS: Bong Joon Ho, Han Jin Wan CAST: Song Kang Ho, Lee Sun Kyun, Cho Yeo Jeong, Choi Woo Shik, Park So Dam, Lee Jung Eun, Chang Hyae Jin In the movie, we follow the Kim family who doesn't have much money. By chance, the son in the family starts working for the wealthy Park family. He teaches their daughter English. Now the rest of the family sees opportunities to make money, and they have a plan to remove the rest of the staff who work for the wealthy Park family and then take the jobs themselves.

Bong Joon Ho addresses deeper themes, but he always manages to create entertainment and some surprising scenes that bring out the smile. The movie is mostly charming until the Kim family discovers the big secret of the house.

Then the movie starts to get darker, and it explodes into a wonderful finale where we see and understand the message of the movie. The title of the movie turns things on its head. Because what I thought to be quite obvious at the beginning of the movie is turned upside down and I got an aha experience. Parasites are found in all classes of society.

From a technical aspect I think this was a beautifully crafted film from the direction to the cinematography. There are so many beautiful scenes in the movie, and it's pretty well done considering that most of the action takes place inside the big house and the not so big garden.My favorite sequence is when the Kim family has to run home when the rain is pouring down, and you feel like they're on board the Titanic. They must run from the top and down to the engine room. What a wonderful sequence, and it's so beautiful to watch!

The cast was fantastic, and everyone fit the needs of their roles. The characters were well-written with the performances complementing that perfectly. It does a great job of creating a collection of characters that feel like real people, whom despite their eccentricities, maintained a grounded, realistic feel.The musical score complements the scenes nicely and elevates the emotional responses without feeling overbearing.

So, if you like foreign films, thrillers, or movies that can make you think a little check this one out. It's a crisp film from a technical aspect, and with a blend of great writing and acting you can't go wrong. It was a solid film that treats the audience with intelligence. 9/10","Feb 9, 2020"

9,"Exceptional piece on class, culture, and family.","Watching a movie in another language sometimes creates a barrier, but great film making and writing can instead, turn that into a bridge, and such is one of Parasite's strengths. I never felt out of touch with what was going on because I didn't understand that culture or anything along those lines, and that's why I highly recommend this movie to anyone. Parasite also has many outstanding shots and high level filmmaking in general. Visuals never dissapoint. The movie is so well paced and gets pretty wild toward the end without being ridiculous. The twists and turns it made were one of the most entertaining Ive seen in a while. There isn't much else to disect. Just go watch it.","Jan 16, 2020"
9,genial way of illustrating social layers,"Parasite represents the example of a movie illustrating the social gap between the poor and the rich. With it's absurd language, utilizes a lot of theatrical elements. I recommend this to everyone who wants to laugh and cry at the same time. This movie will make you think about your place in society, but it will not make you sorry for occupying that place. There are a lot of movies about thic topic, but most of them take themselves too seriously, and their goal is to awake guilt in the spectator, thus the true message will be hidden under that feeling. In contrary, Parasite uses the language of humor, irony and absurdity. I think Bertolt Brecht would be proud of this masterpiece.","Dec 27, 2020"

At times, It had me on the edge of my seat, other times it had me laughing out loud. Don't let the subtitles put you off either. I got so sucked into this movie that I forgot they were even there. This movie is so different to most, I feel I haven't watched anything like this before. Ignore the negative reviews. I have read some saying this movie is overrated and terrible, then i noticed the grammar and the spelling and it all made sense. They didn't understand it. This movie is VERY good.

9,"It'll make you laugh, cry and probably check your basement","I had no expectations walking into Parasite, but now my love and appreciation for it has breached the stratosphere. This is definitely one of the best movies of 2019, and it's bound to be a classic.

It's directed by Bong Joon-ho, he did Snowpiercer (2013) and Okja (2017), and now he's back with Parasite and it is fantastic. From a directing standpoint, this movie is gorgeous. The cinematography is extremely well done. It's just stunning and so metaphorical. There are also sequences in this movie that will shake you and leave you on the edge of your seat.

My favourite aspect is the narrative. I love the concept that Parasite is built on and what it explores throughout the movie, with the conflict and contrast between upper and lower cIasses of society. It was just beautiful to watch it play out, with its prevalence within the lives of all the characters, along with how they overcome their difficulties and how they evolve with their circumstances.

The characters and performances themselves are also amazing. The entire cast is just perfect in each of their roles and I really hope they get some recognition from the Academy. I don't think many people mentioned the character arcs but I thought that was really well constructed too.

The score and sound design by Jeong Jae-il was also perfect in every scenario. It brings scenes from 100 to 1000 and emphasises each tone, emotion and atmosphere.

In regards to flaws, I don't think there are any major ones with Parasite. There is one decision made in the third act that I felt could've been better explored to support it. But still it didn't really bother me.

Parasite is probably my favourite movie of 2019. It's funny, thrilling, emotional, satirical and hauntingly true. It's delivers everything that makes a movie perfect and shakes you to your core.","Dec 7, 2019"
9,"A superb combination of comedy and tragedy, laugh and cry, joy and sympathy","Comedy and tragedy, the combination of the two is what a Korean filmmaker really good at, and Bong Joon Ho is no exception. Started with comedy, you'll find yourself laughing and going with the flow as the movie suddenly change its color in the middle of it like you have never expected before: the reality of living in poverty in modern world, where one and one's family (and spouses) can automatically be dehumanized by society, with the same level of rats and cockroaches. The opposite goes for the movie itself, as it humanized itself when the two most tragic characters in the movie got snapped and decided that it's enough. One of the most important movie in 2019. Movies like this need to be produced more, and, if possible, outnumber the high-budgeted, massively-hyped, full-CGI, full-action movies.","Jun 28, 2019"
9,"Simple put, a truly great film. One to watch for anyone interested in the art of filmmaking.","This is one of the rare times I whole heartedly agree with the Oscars. Since I saw this film yesterday, I haven't been able to stop thinking about it, and it still have left a feeling in my gut and its visuals still lives in my mind. This is what movie making is all about, it's artistically beautiful, it's entertaining, it manage to capture your attention and is interesting and thought provoking. It makes you feel and think, simple put.

It reminded me a little bit of Get Out, even if very different movies also. I haven't seen that many Korean movies, 5 perhaps, and some of those are some of the best movies I've seen, so perhaps should check out some more Korean movies? And Kang-ho Song has been in 3 of them I've seen, so I must believe he's a very famous actor in South Korea, but I wouldn't know. Anyway, the cast of this movie is fantastic, a bunch of very likeable actors, that portrays the absurdity, darkness, drama and comedy of these characters and situations, in an excellent way. This movie is entertaining because of the absurdity of the situations, that these people come to be within, but also still so impactful, beacuse it at the same time it all feels so realistic in a crazy way. The film, with all it different events and character projection, flows perfectly and also with beautiful, just delicious cinematography and set design. Some visuals of this picture will be in my mind for a long time.

And, off course, the underlying meaning of the the film, as I think everybody knows by now, even those that haven't seen it yet, it's about class, poverty VS wealth. Something that has been going on in this world for thousands of years. As present today as it ever been, I suppose. The gap between rich and poor, it is very much a gap, that alienate the classes from each other. And what this film so intelligently does, is that it isn't hitting you over the nose with this message, it's just there, embedded in the story in an obvious but at the same time sublimely way. I think that's masterfully done by the director, beacuse I think that's a hard thing to acchive. To make such a strong comment on society and the human condition, without being obvious or preachy. Just beautiful actually.

There is sympathy and distaste to be found against the personalities in both familys, with distaste perhaps being a bit of a strong of a word, their human, their very very human, and you can understand both sides. Humans are selfish by nature and both sides just does what's in their best interest. No one sets out to be, or wants to be, immoral or evil, people just live in their own worlds, their own bubbles, and only cares for their own immediate occurrences and problems. Why wouldn't they? Why shouldn't they? Not being either rich or poor myself, I can relate to both sides in this movie. This movie also portrays so well, how different these lifestyles are. How the living conditions of the poor family (don't remember their last name) is just straight up unhealthy, and how secluded and oblivious the luxurious conditions of the rich family is, from the travasties of the poor, the contrast of these two extremely different living conditions is shown again and again, but mostly by imagery in subtle ways, but also so obvious in their subtleties, so it's even more obvious and impactful. On top of that, the film is dark and humorous for entertaining purposes. Witch great acting.

And also, without giving anything away, how the occurrences unfolds towards the end, is not only to give the movie an entertaining and impactful climax/conclusions. It also portrays the real tension of the underlying currents these gaps and problems in society creats. How the big differences and separation of living standards for people, can lead to drastic and devastating outcomes even. But think this movie can probably be interperted in many different ways, and these are just my own interpretations.","May 12, 2020"

9,Another proof that South Korean cinema is special,"Funny, scarcastic, touching, emotional... the movie builds up as a comedy but then shows the family drama and depicts a modern south korean society where the rich live in another galaxy, so far yet so close from a family of ""untouchables"".

9,CROSSING THE LINE,"Rooting for an impoverished but resourceful underdog struggling to make ends meet, sets up a standard feel good movie scenario. Seemingly innocuous, ""Parasite"" captures the lively trials of the Kim family as they scheme and trick their way into cushy employment, starting an invasion of sorts. The web of lies in an escalating con targeting the insensitive and gullible Park family opens a series of mouth watering doors, but alas, there's always some that should remain shut.

Whether it's borders, classes, or smells, everyone has a line, that once crossed, destroys most semblance of rationale. ""Parasite"" brilliantly dissects how these boundaries (however personal and subjective) are developed within our very complicated and unique species.

Filmed almost exclusively within the two families' domiciles, one a filthy, cramped basement apartment, the other a glorious, spacious and meticulously spotless mansion on the hill, ""Parasite"" offers an obvious and very deep class chasm as plot kindling.

Delicious absurdist touches like peach fuzz allergies, hammer throw expertise, American Indian infatuations, and wifi signal hunting, are peppered throughout offering much welcomed distraction. Spinning an endearing class dichotomy comedy wildly out of control adds white knuckle power to the jarring second act. Sides are drawn early on, making it is easy to cheer for the bottom feeders in this warfare, but not everything on screen is black and white. The consequence of action and reaction during the increasingly muddied grey areas powers this film. What is good? What is evil? How is that line drawn?

Sneaky, powerful, perfectly paced, funny, shocking, and quite wonderful. Can a film be both dark and bright? Yes, yes it can.","Feb 2, 2020"
9,This movie was amazing!!!,"This is the latest movie from South Korean director Bong Joon-ho, director of The Host, Okja, Snowpiercer and more. This is only the second movie of his that I have seen and it really makes me want to watch more! This movie is about a poor family who all get jobs working for a rich family as part of a scheme, and it just gets crazier from there. The performances are excellent, the story is interesting, it looks beautiful, it has comedy, it has suspense, it has horror, it has romance, it has everything! My only complaints are that the movie is a little slow in the first act and that sometimes the dialogue went by too fast for me to read the subtitles. This is good writing, and I feel like I missed some of it. I'm a pretty slow reader though, so your experience may differ. And yeah, the movie is presented in its original language and subtitled. If that's an issue for you, don't see it. You won't enjoy it. Otherwise, if you want an exciting and well-made movie that is completely original, go see this movie! It's one of the best of the year!","Dec 1, 2019"
9,Oscar granted and well earned,"Ok, the korean guys are always seen as the second or third best movie makers in the hollywood and bollywood businness but hold on.

I started watching with the idea: why the damn a korean movie earned so many academy oscars, what did the US movie makers have forgotten that this movie stamps it.

It doesnt show it clearly at the start but after all the movie scenario been stablished something good is not right.

9,Definitely a worth the watch,"Even though it took a while for me to catch up with the scenes and the translated English subtitles, (as I do not understand the regional language), the movie kept me glued to the screen the entire time.

The movie is sure to give to chills in the spine by the end, as all the super richie-rich, goody-goody, cute-cute, sophisticated scenes suddenly goes down the drain (literally, with the floods).

Loopholes: The movie would had been even more realistic if - they had shown how a person feels the pinch of sunlight when they come out of the basement and sees the sun after a long time. Rubbing through eyes and showing the transition while entering the kitchen would have made the scene look more real.

Living in the basement would make the skin dull and pale. But the characters looked as healthy as ever, even after staying there for over 4 years.

Instead of all clean shaven and hair styled up, showing haphazard hair growth and beards would have made the characters look more genuine.

The scenes never showed any traces of blood footprints after all the murdering, especially, when Kang-ho song escapes.

Plus points: Overall, it was definitely worth a watch as it showcases the socioeconomic gap and difference.

As I firmly believe that there are only two religions - the rich and the poor. The movie proved that a rich person's life goes on while the poor keeps struggling for the rest of their life.","Mar 28, 2020"
9,Human nature,"Theme is nothing new, a topic of gap between rich and poor ones, which an social issue we hear everyday.

The director nail it by showing a serious theme but in an very entertaining way. Awesome movie!","Aug 9, 2019"
9,Incredible Slow Burning Thriller and a Social Satire From Joon-ho Bong,"Parasite is a film that is so well crafted, so well told and original that I was left thinking non stop about it for days. Parasite is a film that you should know as little as possible about before watching as it weaves such an interesting and compelling narrative that will have you hooked in minutes. It is occasionally funny, often tense, sometimes shocking and always interesting. Within ten minutes of watching the film I figured out that this would be a slow burning film where the tension rises until everything comes to ahead and it did not disappoint. The film isn't shot in a flashy stylish way but it is still beautiful to look at and is shot superbly and subtly. The acting is good across the board with all the main cast getting moments to shine. The characters are all well thought out and three dimensional all having their own desires and motives. Parasite also has a strong social commentary to make (that I wont discuss for spoilers sake) but is not heavy handed and is slightly present at the beginning before it hits you hard towards the end. This film is so close to perfect but is let down by its ending. If the film had left the ending more ambiguous and finished 5-10 minutes earlier I would have given Parasite a ten. After seeing the film there is no question on why it won the Palme d'Or at Cannes and is one of the best films of 2019 by far.","Jul 11, 2019"

The themes are common enough, but told in such a way, and with such a unique story, to be legitimately fresh. The subtle nuances of performance can sometimes get lost in subtitles, but not in this case - each actor transcends language in conveying their character. The plot twists and turns between random chuckles and stark darkness from the start to the shocking, sad and satisfying finish.

The hype is real - definitely one of the best movies of the year, and of recent years. Don't miss it.","Jan 21, 2020"

9,Simple yet realistic,"This is undoubtedly one of the best movies of the year and I think the best work of Bong Joon Ho yet. It's a very funny and playful movie. You can't pin it down into one specific genre, much like Bong Joon Ho's other work. Some moments are absurdly funny while others are intense. The premise is about a poor family who lives in a small basement apartment and struggling in their everyday life. One day one of their family members gets a chance to work as an English tutor for the daughter of a wealthy family. The poor family sees this as an opportunity to scam this wealthy family and they find a way to all work for them. Things get more serious after the first half because some stuff happens and the poor family has to deal with it cautiously. What is amazing about this movie is the story is simple and realistic, but told in such a fresh and unique way that it feels relatable and larger than life. The director shows the irony of life. How two separate classes of people in a society perceive things differently. While watching the movie, it was so engaging that I felt like it was controlling me with its beautiful cinematography and well structured plot.","Jan 12, 2020"

9,Parasite leeches onto societal dissociation to create a thrillingly hilarious satire on capitalism.,"""Rich people are naive. No resentments. No creases on them."". ""It all gets ironed out. Money is an iron. Those creases all get smoothed out by money."". The Kim family, residing in the secluded darkness of a semi-underground basement apartment, acquire limited income. Jaggedly folding pizza boxes for an independent takeaway chain, with the already low-paying income reduced as a consequence of poor workmanship. They, much like the bottom-feeders of South Korea's working class division, struggle to survive. Consuming rotting food. Hijacking neighbouring paid Wi-Fi services. Residing in potentially diseased sub-urban streets. Ultimately aspiring to achieve the lofty heights of upper-class formalities. Conceptualising the popularised term ""Hell Joseon"", a critique on the current socioeconomic declining trajectory of South Korea. As the Kims tucked into their minimised dinner, son Ki-woo's university friend gifts the family a scholar's rock. Traditionally granting the bearer a promise of wealth. Swiftly after, he offers a proposition to Ki-woo. To continue his vocation as an English tutor for the elegant daughter of a wealthy family, the Parks. Ki-woo ponders, fabricating a plan that would seize this opportunity for beneficial gain. A chance to relish in the opposing scale of unequalised capitalism. After a successful lesson, Ki-woo insists his awareness for an art therapy teacher at the behest of the gullible Choi Yeon-gyo for her son. Ki-woo, unbeknown to the Parks, invites his sister Ki-jung to provide these lessons. Gradually, the Kim family, one-by-one, assimilate themselves into the lives of the Park family, pretending to be unrelated. The poor draining the wealth and opportunism from the rich.

Before tackling this critically lauded feature, which has now grown to be one of the highest-rated productions of all-time in such an inconsequential amount of time, the black humour of director Joon-ho's filmography acted as preparation for what was to be expected. Providing critiques on sociopolitical endeavours that overburden an OECD nation. Predictably, yet efficiently, Joon-ho's darkly comedic satire on class conflict manages to succinctly tackle the enragement of allocated resources that supplies social inequality and wealth disparity through the microcosmic insight of two opposing families. Not just in prosperity or affluence, but in temperament. A reflection of late-stage capitalism where the enticingly inviting wealthy superfluously ignore the difficulties of life for the remaining population. Youth unemployment at the expense of extortionate higher education fees. Affordability for shelter and essential food items rapidly dissipating along with the lower class. The Kims perpetuate these foreboding crises, utilising fraudulent and forgery crimes to attain the standard of living that many aspire to achieve. Yet, beneath the sharply hilarious foundations of Joon-ho's screenplay, which confidently satirises the naivety and credulity of opulence whilst embedding thought-provoking themes of affirmative contemplation and economic disassociation, is a visceral vision of palpable colonialism.

The Parks original housekeeper Gook Moon-gwang imitating North Korea's dictatorial leader, whom openly yearns to invade South Korea, mimicking the voice and mannerisms of a propagandist news reporter. Before engaging in a fight with the Kims for social dominance, a microcosm for the poor fighting the poor. The Parks' son, Da-song, frolicking in the freshly sprinkled garden in an ""Indian"" outfit, memorialising colonial occupation. Whilst these are included as surface-level replications, the contextual substance beneath these depictions hark back to the economic order of capitalism. The poor decline, and the rich rise. The latter viewing the former as parasitical microbes feeding off of their principled success. Staircases acting as prominent motifs to accentuate economic disparity, with Kyung-pyo's clinically precise cinematography emphasising their thematic purpose through extensive shots from banished basements and luxurious lounges.

Coincidentally, Joon-ho intelligently avoids assigning protagonists, rather viewing the perspectives of both social classes as unethical divisions of society, with the ""upstairs/downstairs"" ideology implying this viewpoint. Each cast member supplying bountiful amounts of energy and deliverance in depicting the social divide. Kang-ho and Yeo-jeong especially, with their eccentric portrayals of two parents from each end of the divide. The onscreen chemistry between Woo-shik and So-dam also enhanced the close familial bonds within the Kim family, working as a crime syndicate rather than individuals.

Every technicality and thematic endeavour was on course for perfection. From Jae-il's orchestral score to Jin-mo's precise editing. All Joon-ho had to do, to truly finish with finesse, was solidify a resonant conclusion. For a moment, with Ki-taek rampantly abandoning Da-song's birthday party, he did. Fade to black. A statement on everything that was depicted previously was conceptualised in these final moments. Perfection! Alas, the feature resumed, and it kept going. The aftermath of the party, narration included, and the proceeding weeks unfortunately quelled the outstanding momentum that preceded the lavishly wrapped conclusion. In spite of the proposed incalculable unlikelihood of the climactic fantasy scenario, heavily inferring the inescapable boundaries of the proposed ""coup de grace"" for a particular individual, it was too immaculate. Heavy-handedly providing implications in a film that astoundingly dealt with nuanced subtextual thematic representations.

However, despite the agitated reservations for Joon-ho's embellished ending, Parasite is a dramatic journey that is boundless in scope. Seamlessly blending genres through prosperous performances and luxurious direction, Joon-ho fully realises the dual meaning behind the feature's title through sheer confidence. The poor infiltrating the wealthy, and the rich leeching off of the working-class' labour. Society is self-parasitical. No grand life plan will change that. ""You know what kind of plan never fails? No plan at all"".","Jun 2, 2020"
9,A Korean Masterpiece,"Parasite is undoubtedly the best film of this year. It's very well directed with a engaging background score, captivating screenplay and stunning cinematography.

The film flows through multiple genres from comedy and drama in first half to horror and thriller in second.

Story revolves around a impoverished household trying to procure jobs in a wealthy family using unscrupulous methods. Bong-joon-ho deals with more than one philosophical arguments throughout the movie but never loses his focus of the central plot.

With masterful direction of Bong-joon-ho, film was able to smoothly transition from a tone of comedy to tragedy effortlessly. Parasite might be his best work to date.","Sep 4, 2019"
9,"""Call me by your Name"" meets ""The last of the Mohicans"" - a brilliant cinematic acievement","""Parasite"" is freaking awesome.It is a comedy, a family drama, a thriller, a horror, a political comentery, a social drama, a an action piece, you have to watch it to believe it. It is just every cool, fun and clever movie shrinked into 2 hours and 15 minutes of pure and unstoppable laughter, some masive and engaging thrills and a story about the distinctio of classes and th edynamic of a family trying to make ends meet.

The cinematography is really distinct andI like that Asian films have a reather common but unqiue look and tone and creates a magical atmosphere and tone. The way the camera moves is so sweet and subtle, the framing, the long shots, it is just so fun to watch. The lighting is beautiful, the way certain rooms are lit give a darker or lighter tone. It never tries to show off and everytihng feels so organic that at one point you forget you are watching fictional characters and a made-up story.

The soundtrack is another thing to praise of. Most of the tracks are classic music and although it often feels so contradictory to the film, the result is so great and so much personality was added to the movie.

The great thing is that despite that the characters have not such a deep arc or are given any major traits, I was able to connect with them in the end and the whole film feels like a big family struggle. You grow with them and graually start to care, in site of their anethical and cheaty choices and actions. Evey actor gives such an appealing perormance and some of their reactinons are really on spot.

The humour is there mostly during the first hour. It is seet and it feels genuine, it what family members would talk and joke about. It creates an intimacy and a fun time. Then we get a lot of shifts in the tone and the twists come and go and the great thing is that the film is constalnty on the go, it is always moving forward and does not waste any moment...and in the end the Parasite is a great story toold in the best way possible.

The political comentary is perfect. There is actually a film that was released last and I vastly enjoyed... ""Burning"". Biurning was about a trouble guy feeling mad that his friend is dating a ritch successful man and he has nobody and actually talks about class discretions in a fascinting way. Parasite does the sam thing but in a different way. In the movie, we see a poor family trying to work together to scam some narrow-minded ritch family that live in a huge house with their luxuries and all. It is what ""Us"" went for but done in a more clear nd subtle way. The ritch use the poor and the poor try to become the ritch. You either leave in a fancy house with a garden and a maid or in the ground floor with insects and a smell. It is like two different words that slowly destroy each other.

I will not say more. Watch this film and I hope you enjoy it as much as I do. I laughed, gasped, fell into thoughts, I was moved and always wanted more. It is a genius fraud, it has several ""peach scenes"", a crazy artistic kid, a birthday party and just make a plan and go watch. In fact, don't make a plan. Just watch it.","Oct 20, 2019"
9,"Precise, thoughtful, and awesome twist. SEE THIS IN THEATER","I had high expectations for this movie, considering it won best picture at Cannes this past year, and it exceeded them. It's a film with thoughtful socioeconomic commentary, as well as an examination of nihilism through the lens of a struggling family. Drawing on the stark lifestyle differences of an upper class Korean family, and another family that is barely making ends meet folding pizza boxes, the audience is able to visualize what a family will do to improve their current financial situation. Without giving away any spoilers, the movie is packed with hilariously sharp moments, and as an American seeing this movie reading the subtitles may have helped those moments shine even brighter. The intertwining of suspense, humor, and social commentary makes it hard not to be reminded of Jordan Peele's ""Get Out,"" so it's a blast to see it in theaters. At a time when originality is lacking at every corner, ""Parasite"" comes through in nearly every way and should be a lock for best foreign film of the year. I wouldn't be surprised if it generated some best picture buzz as well. Great movie!","Oct 29, 2019"
9,Brilliant film,"Parasite is one of those films that completely flips your expectations in the best way possible. At first, it feels like a dark comedy about a poor family scheming their way into a rich household, but then it shifts into something much deeper and darker. Bong Joon-ho does an incredible job of blending genres-you'll be laughing one minute and then sitting on the edge of your seat the next. The whole cast is flawless, but Song Kang-ho really stands out as the father who's caught between two worlds. What's amazing is how Parasite tackles huge themes like class, privilege, and inequality without ever feeling preachy. Every scene is layered with meaning, and there's this constant tension building throughout. The way it all comes together in the end is just... wow. It's the kind of movie that stays with you, making you think about the society we live in and the invisible barriers that divide us. Honestly, it's one of the most brilliant films I've seen in a long time-an absolute must-watch.","Sep 23, 2024"

9,CHEER! - (9 stars out of 10),"The stage curtains open ...

It takes a lot for me to invest into a foreign film where I have to watch it with subtitles, and I will usually pass unless it is an exceptional film. The last such film I can remember watching was the 2007 Spanish supernatural film, ""The Orphanage"", which I did feel was exceptionally good. So, when I read the reviews on ""Parasite"" and seeing that it had won Best Picture, I decided to go ahead and take the plunge ... and I'm so glad I did.

Our story starts with the Kim family, struggling financially and trying to make ends meet when the son, Ki-woo, is given the opportunity to tutor a rich family's teenage daughter. Taking the job, Ki-woo begins to manufacture reasons to trick the privileged family into hiring his father, mother and sister in various capacities, while they pretend to be complete strangers to each other. The scheme is going well, until one of the former house employees returns to the home requesting to be let in because, in her haste to leave, she had left something important behind. When they allow her inside, that is when it all begins to unravel with very unexpected results.

I absolutely loved this twisted film! Despite the subtitles, I was completely sucked in, and found myself grinning with guilty pleasure at the predicaments that this opportunist family was placed into in their efforts to keep their devious plan from being discovered. The outcome was not what I expected, but completely satisfying. The pacing was excellent, the acting above average, and the cinematography solid. The film featured a strong use of lighting and colors that adds to the feel and atmosphere effectively.

This is one of the few foreign films (well, foreign to me, that is) that I would highly recommend, without hesitation. It is well deserving of its praises, and well worth the time invested into it. I have added it to my own collection and am looking forward to watching it again down the road. A high 9 stars out of 10.","Apr 6, 2021"

I don't want to spoil the movie but the plot is good too. I didn't like the first few minutes of the movie because of some cringeworthy acting but as the movie progresses they all reedeem themselves. Some scenes were forced into the movie which didn't contribute in any way to the plot of the movie. The cinematography was flawless. And the ending was bittersweet which according to me is perfect. Overall, it is a must watch movie.","Dec 25, 2019"
9,Clever suspenseful original,I felt the same way as when watcjing Knives Out. Wondering the whole time what's gonna happen next? Never a dull moment. And the story unfolds at a good pace. I felt slightly uncomfortable the whole time. But not too much that I didn't want to finish watching it. I like movies that allow me to watch and allow it to tell me the story as it unfolds. This did that. Great movie.,"Jan 5, 2020"
9,Parasite Is,"Satisfying and unexpected unfolding of plot. Put you through different emotional states during its runtime Despite of conflict in mind about actors and villain, all characters are equally valuable. You will care for each of them. It almost covers all of the genre","Mar 24, 2020"
9,Powerful,"Such a powerful allegory for the increasing wealth gap in the world. The scenes in the basement were chilling, especially that first one. The poor scurrying like cockroaches when the lights come on, swimming in their own filth during that flood scene, and turning against one another ... it was all devastating commentary on the position they're in, and the struggle. The rich guy who seems nice enough, but just the mere smell of the poor, or them not staying in their place and crossing the line he has in his mind which makes him quickly remind them of their relative positions ... it's a fantastic characterization, and I loved how it all built up into a crescendo with the opulence of that kid's birthday party. This is a message film that works on both levels, as it's hard to know how it will play out, and while dark, it's entertaining. The ending is brilliant too.","Dec 3, 2019"

9,Who is the real parasite ?,"For most of us this one is first ever experience of South Korean movie And it is amazing experience

Movie introduces us to the culture of S Korea. Which is similar to. many Asian countries and something are new to us

As the movie name is Parasite. Movie depicts rawness. That every human being contains parasite deep down

Movie is brilliant in every aspects. Parasite has. Comedy ; fun ; sadness ; brutality ; depressing ; family bonding ; intimacy ; strictness ; thrilling ; darkness etc...

9,From WhatsApp to Morse Code,"Seoul, a basement dwelling. Having access to someone else's free wlan is one of the main concerns of its residents for not being cut off from the world of WhatsApp.

Seoul, a private fallout shelter in a modern luxurious villa. The only way left to communicate with the outside world is the light of a bulb by using morse code.

In between these 2 scenes we get to see 120 min of a freaky class conflict, in which a family of unemployed sneaks access to a mansion of the riches. They get the first foot in by chance but from that point on, they show great manipulative and deceitful talent to get all feet in. Everything seems to work out fine until the former housekeeper returns in a rainy night. From that point on the story is turned completely upside down and becomes an entirely unpredictable hullabaloo.

I liked the fact that the movie does not side with either of the parties. Neither poor nor rich are presented in a very favorable way. Especially the patronizing behavior of Mr. Top Manager towards his new chauffeur is quite striking and doomed to create a backlash ...

Not all parts of the story are fully convincing. In my eyes, it is quite unlikely that a family of low social class has the ability to show such good manners and education as presented in the movie.

Oh well, it is still a clear recommendation. You shall be surprised more than once.","Aug 21, 2020"
9,A masterpiece as both a social commentary and cinematic experience...and one of this year's best! 9/10 ⭐,"In the latest film of Bong Joon-Ho (Salinui chueok (2003), Seolgungnyeolcha (2013)), we are given a story that, in a brilliant turn of events, sees the day-to-day lives of two Korean families intertwined. These families couldn't be more dissimilar; one makes money from folding pizza boxes & steals the wifi of nearby cafes while the other lives like royalty, served by maids and taken around by drivers.

The income disparity is quickly made apparent to us and in a string of events I don't want to spoil here, the poorer family finds themselves usurping one role at a time of the richer family until they all find themselves employed by the rich. And yet they have to act like total strangers with one another. How this is all written, directed and acted plays off incredibly well.

""Parasite"" really surprised me in that it takes you on a whirlwind of emotions. It's storytelling is ambitious and takes chances in veering off-tone and off-the-book, so to speak. I found myself dying of laughter at some parts, tense or sad at others and purely enchanted throughout. All of this while showcasing some of the most unique storytelling I've ever witnessed.

Certain to nab a Best Foreign Film nomination at the Academy Awards and perhaps even a Best Director & Best Picture nod, ""Parasite"" is certainly one of the year's best. Arguably even one the decade's best. It's all in the little details whether it's using a keen sense of lighting, composition or blocking to reveal something. Give this one a watch and you'll see what I mean. Masterpiece!","Nov 1, 2019"
9,Good movie and would watch it again,"It was a interesting movie for sure. I would happily watch it again. I wish i knew korean however subtitles isnt so bad. The only reason i saw this movie was because it has won lots of awards and every reporter keeps giving it best score, i agree.","Nov 19, 2020"
9,Recommended,"Original.

If you're a film junkie like myself then you'll appreciate the time and effort that Bong Joon Ho and everyone else put in to make this happen.

Let it win the best film in the foreign film category. Some weird political shenanigans going on there. ""Ripley's Believe It Or Not"". The film, even with subtitles, keeps you immersed and forgetting that ""time has flown by"" which you want from a cleverly crafted movie. The film gently builds to an almighty OMG.

Simple in it's beginning for a family wanting to find a living then a brilliant comedic lie to earn it and the complex aftermath it creates only to end in a mirage.

9,a film that has already grown on me since watching it hours ago,Bong joon ho is clearly a talented director from everything i have seen from him he has a key eye for slowly drawing you into the plot and keeping you at the edge of your seat i also loved how the story played with your expectations for characters in the film this film was the first in a long while that made me legitimately feel nervouse for the characters being discovered i won't spoil it but you will know what i mean when u see the film for yourself the only complants i had would be a few scenes went on a bit too long and i kept misleading myself into thinking it was going to end sooner then it did but i imagine on my second watch these issues won't be a big deal to me i mean this film has already been creeping into my thoughts since seeing it hours earlier i'm not sure if this film is a 8 or 9 or how the film holds up to the directors previous works but this film is worth your attention please if your sick of the hollywood garbage that is turned out in your local cinema please look for a cinema that's playing parasite it's worth your time and i feel it might be my favourite movie that's come out this year so get hyped and check it out and if your new to the director check out his previous movies the host and especially mother are some of his best but parasite is up there with them check it out,"Jun 28, 2019"
9,Parasite by Bong Joon Ho,"The stories about the social classes, have been interestingly often explored in the books, television series, movies and so on. Especially to see how the main characters, would get through their difficulties by facing them, in the line between poverty and wealth. These stories often explore the theme about hope, to see how the main characters, who have so much will in their souls, would try in all the way to help their family. Some of these stories would end, with the main characters who become wealthy, to help their family with satisfaction. Other stories would end with the main characters, who are still struggling with what they are facing to, without losing any hope even it would take a long time to accomplish something important. The auteur filmmaker Bong Joon Ho have been interested, in making a story which explores this theme. As the audience have been really curious, what the new movie of the filmmaker would be about, once it has been announced. After a long time of work, in 2019 came out Parasite by Bong Joon Ho with Song Kang Ho, Lee Sun Kyun, Cho Yeo Jeong, Choi Woo Shik and Park So Dam. The movie's plot: The unemployed Kim Ki-woo (Choi Woo Shik) takes the opportunity, to work as an English tutor for the daughter of the wealthy Park Family. Then Kim Ki-woo would slowly bring his whole family, his father Kim Ki-taek (Song Kang Ho), his mother Kim Chung-sook (Chang Hyae Jin) and his sister Kim Ki-jung (Park So Dam), to get each of them a job in the Park Family. Until something unexpected is going to happen, to get a dramatic consequence. From the beginning to the end, the movie would surprise the audience, through the most unexpected twists, especially if something wrong is going to happen, then the Kim Family must find new solutions to not get in trouble. In the same way, the movie gets emotional to see how the Kim family, is so united to never let anything to divide them. The monologues and dialogues were elaborated, to see how the main characters would find new plans, for what they are looking for. Also to let the audience feel the deep meaning of the dialogues and the monologues, especially between the Kim family when they talk about important topics. The camera and the lightings work to be compatible, in ever single camera movements as well as in every single angle shots, to make the sequences look like paintings needed for the Mise en scènes. The editing was specifically elaborated for the narration's rhythm, without ruining it, as well as to build tension in the most unexpected moments. Song Ka Ho was extraordinary as Kim Ki-taek, who would be then the one to tell his son about the meaning if it is necessary or not to have plans. Choi Woo Shik was excellent as Kim Ki-woo, who once works for Park Family he would try to make sure his family have a better life. Chang Hyae Jin did a very well done job as Kim Chung-sook, who would do anything just for her family and not for anybody else. Park So Dam was excellent as Kim Ki-jung, who in the course of the story would just do whatever is necessary to take important decisions. The score by Jung Jaeil was elaborated, to let the audience feel the thrilling moments as well as the emotional moments, to be unforgettable in every single musical notes. Parasite is one of the best movies of 2019, as well as one of the greatest and most unique masterpieces of all time.","Dec 14, 2019"
9,A must watch,"A New kind of story with an amazing take on the economic instability in the Korean society

A nice way to depict the ecnomic imbalance in the society with a beautiful and unthinkable script

A must watch story and too many hidden messages or meaning in the script","Jul 13, 2020"
9,Extremely well-crafted but could be tired at times.,"I was bombarded by ppl recommending this movie to me so when I finally saw it, I was a bit underwhelmed - or you can say I was overhyped before. The main complaint - I was not ""blown away"" by any element of the movie. I know that's a high standard but with a score of 95 it should do exceptionally in some aspects. Instead, this movie did just ""pretty good"" in all of them.

Movie about class struggles might be new and exciting to US viewers but is - I don't want to say cliched - a pretty common theme in East Asia. Juxtaposing two closely-related group of characters with some uncrossable divides that ultimately result in conflict that reflects on the society itself is also a tried and true storytelling device.

Execution of the movie is professional and top-notch. Almost all actions by the characters have meticulous setups (some of them a bit in the face), which, on the bright side, shows the movie was extremely well-thought out and executed. Yet it simultaneously takes away any true element of surprise - a bit over-crafted, I'd say, which is a bit ironic in a highly choreographed dark humor genre movie but bear with me.

Character arcs are well-justified but predictable; was most impressed by the detailed and vivid portrayal of classism through a non-visual medium - smell. The juxtapositions of the underground v. above ground, the pre- and post- discovered housekeeper, and the weather changes vs the mood of the characters was effective but a bit on the nose.

Last, the cinematography was beautiful, the tone was unique and well-balanced, and the performance was amazing. Overall, a highly polished and accomplished movie. Yet I failed to see much ingenuity. It felt like the director hides behind his craftsmanship to avoid showing the audience his true self.","Dec 12, 2019"
9,Big Brain Bong,"Written and Directed by Bong Joon-Ho, Parasite evolves into something so gripping and unusual. While this would be seen as a thriller by many, it's also a dark comedy. This can often a very difficult thing to pull of, as too many tones can often leave an audience confused and disengaged. It also plays to audience's expectations only to then completely subvert them when you think you know whats going to happen. Parasite executes this all of these elements amazingly through Bong Joon-Ho's incredible direction and writing. Dialogue has depth and sounds organic. The themes that Parasite explores really hit home by the end of the movie and takes us to some unexpectedly emotional resolutions of character arcs. The cast which consists of Woo-sik Choi, Hye-jin Jang, So-dam Park and long term collaborator Kang-ho Sang, are all at the top of their game here, with an especially phenomenal performance by Kang-ho Sang. Cinematographer Kyung-pyo Hung returns with might be his best work yet. The sound design is great and the score fits perfectly and helps add to the tension of the movie.

All of these elements combine to make an incredibly satisfying movie, while also being highly re-watchable. When introducing someone to foreign language movie, this would be one the first i'd recommend.","Aug 29, 2019"

9,Unique and eye-catching,"It's rare to experience stories like this... it really drags you in. I'm surprised, throughout the film, you start to expect what will be next, but it has great twists that wash your expectations out of the ocean.","Oct 29, 2019"
9,Masterpiece,"Parasite is, if not the best, definitely one of the top 5 movies of 2019. The film is almost perfect in every aspect possible.

Both the cinematographer Kyung-pyo Hong and the director Bong Joon-ho make an outstanding job with a production design that is off the charts. These three aspects together result in one of the most eye-grabbing movies of the decade. Every shot is, at the same time, beautiful and meaningful, to the point that you could understand the whole movie even if it had no dialogues.

The screenplay is also one of the strengths of the film. Bong Joon-ho and Han Jin-won came up with a great idea that is as original as it gets and managed to make it funny, interesting, sarcastic, sad and verisimilar. The movie shows the difference between classes like ""Roma"" (2018), but has the rhythm and its core similar to ""Get Out!"" (2017).

Every character is important and has its moment of protagonism. Due to the complexity and the nuances put in the screenplay, none of the characters is a villain or a hero. The only villains in this story are the unfairness of the capitalistic society and the lack of empathy of wealthy people towards the less resourceful ones.

The acting by all the main cast is sublime, but the highlights are Kang-ho Song and Yeo-jeong Jo. Kang-ho plays Kim Ki-taek, father of the Kim family. He captures the essence of this experienced man that has gone through a lot in his life and has his pride taken from him in the course of the movie, making his character's arc of development the most interesting of the film. Yeo-jeong plays Yeon-gyo, mother of the Park family. She is the complete opposite of Ki-taek; she's naive and has, and seemingly has always had, an easy life. She's clearly not aware of the things that happen outside her bubble, and that makes her vulnerable to smart people like the Kim family.

Last, but definitely not least, the music. It dictates the current state of the film and manipulates the spectator so you get absolutely fixated on the screen. It has hints of suspense, comedy and even horror.

Parasite (2019) is one of the finest movies made in the past decade and, most certainly, deserves a watch. It's eye-grabbing in every sense of the word and really fun to watch, but is also very dense and insightful, providing a vision of how things work that's not usually shown in the mainstream content.","Jan 25, 2020"
9,A stunning depiction of the flaws of social mobility,Without giving away any major plot points Parasite can only be described as one of the most unmistakable yet subtle pieces of social commentary of the 21st century. Focused around the idea of class divide it explores the unavailability of social mobility as broken system and highlights the nonchalant attitude of the upper classes towards less fortunate people. Shot beautifully and includes an incredible performance by Kang So Hong. All round a brilliant film.,"Feb 19, 2020"
9,A Darkly Hilarious Dive into Class Struggles,"Set in South Korea, Parasite is like a rollercoaster ride through the twisted maze of class divides, where the rich are living it up in their fancy mansions while the rest of us plebs are left scraping by like crumbs on the floor.

The story follows the Kim family, a bunch of scrappy hustlers who manage to wriggle their way into the lives of the wealthy Park family faster than you can say ""social climbing"". It's like watching a game of cat and mouse, except the cats are wearing designer suits and the mice are pulling off the heist of the century.

Now, I won't spoil the plot twists for you, but let's just say things take a turn for the... well, let's just say they take a turn. And it's not pretty. But what is pretty is the way Bong Joon-ho manages to blend dark humor with biting social commentary like a master chef whipping up a gourmet meal.","May 5, 2024"

The superb directing, and In particular writing style of this screenplay complement to each other and will not disappoint. I was so pleased that the ending of the film ties the rest of the storyline together and really does justice for the rest of the film, cause who likes a bad ending? This film did get a standing ovation at the Cannes Film Festival and it was defiantly deserved.","Sep 10, 2019"

9,Among the best films of this decade!,"If Memories of Murder did not solidify Mr. Bong's place as one of this century's greatest artists, then this film certainly did. I cannot remember the last time I saw a film this great in theaters. By a full 1.5 stars, this film has replaced Once Upon a Time in Hollywood as my favorite film of 2019. Of course, that is subject to change, but I can't see this being beat any time soon.

Parasite is a film about which I think I should say as little as possible. Knowing nothing about the plot going in was a great benefit. The film has so much to say about class, about wealth, about family, about society. It is all so focused and direct. The movie never meanders or wanders off to other topics. It is excellently paced and has fantastic editing. The script is so well-written, both in terms of dialogue, progression of the plot, set-up and payoff, reincorporation, and commentary. The film looks fantastic, as most of this director's other pictures do. The music is pretty great, very well timed and sometimes used for comedic effect. The acting is great, too. Song Kang-Ho is great as usual, but the younger actors and the women do great as well. I especially loved Jo Yeo-Jeong's performance. I think watching this in theaters is definitely worth it if you can manage.

I loved this movie. I think it is a pretty accessible foreign film. My showing was pretty full, and the next two showings were sold out entirely. I'm really happy that people are watching this, and I hope to God that the movie gets the Academy recognition it deserves.

9.5/10, could be a 10 on the second watch.","Nov 5, 2019"

9,Bong Joon Ho did it again.,"From all Asian countries South Korea is definitely the country that releases the best Asian movies. I've seen plenty of good movies from South Korea but Parasite must be the best one thus far. I was surprised (and not) it won all those Oscars but to be honest Bong Joon Ho deserves those awards. He made quality movies before, like Snowpiercer for instance, so it was only a matter of time before he got recognition. In Gisaengchung (Parasite) the acting is very good, not the typical loudspeaking Korean where it looks like they're always mad at something, so for that alone it's worth watching. The story is catching, well written, and keeps you at the edge of your seat for the entire movie. The difference between the poor and the rich, the envy, the jealousy, the scamming, it's all very entertaining. It never felt like a long movie because it's just well made and it's a refreshing story, not one of those stories that has been done over and over again. I'm glad it won the Oscar for best foreign picture, totally deserved.","Mar 19, 2020"
9,just a great deep movie,"Well conducted, superb performance, the movie seems to catch the futility of having too much money and still being blind to others not so fortunate. I really enjoyed the movie. Recommended.","Feb 24, 2020"
9,Outstanding Film almost Beautiful,"After only 5 minutes of watching this film you will be fully immersed into an unknown world (at least for outsiders of korean life) and thrown into a tale full of intrigue, wit, laughter and shock. All of this backed up with a smart plot and story twists at every turn ensuring the audience is kept on their toes at all time.

There may be only but a few grey areas of the story that you feel a loss of understanding but that feeling quickly subsides as the next page of the story quickly unfolds.

Great director and great film 9/10","Mar 1, 2020"

9,Smart and suspenseful dark comedy-thriller,"Hollywood wishes it could make a movie like this. Perhaps if Paul Verhoeven was still allowed to make slick satirical blockbusters like he used to, they'd have a shot at matching the Best Picture winner PARASITE.

Without going into heavy spoilers, the movie follows the Kim family who are a lower class clan of con artists that have no qualms about fleecing people. But they are close knit and love each other dearly. Their latest scheme is their most ambitious and riskiest one yet: each Kim family member will get hired by the wealthy Park family for a different occupation and pretend not to be related to one another.

The acting is excellent across the board. The first half is very enjoyable to watch how crafty the Kims are at tricking the affluent if foolish Parks. But then the second half takes a few shocking twists that threaten to upend the Kims' new social standing.

I strongly recommend this movie, it's definitely worth the hype.","Jun 1, 2020"

9,Story of two Korean families,"This is the first time I can remember that a Korean-language film has been nominated for the Best Picture Oscar, and it is also nominated for Academy Awards in the International Feature (former Foreign Language Film), Original Screenplay, Production Design, Editing, and Director (Bong Joon Ho) categories as well. It is already the first Korean film to win the Palme d'Or at the Cannes film festival. This movie was funnier than I was expecting. Set in Seoul, it shows a poor family, the Kims, ingratiating themselves with a rich one, the Parks. The members of the rich family are actually quite decent, although somewhat condescending and gullible, and the Kims are likable rogues. The Kims, consisting of a father, mother, son, and daughter, live in a semi-basement apartment that looks out on an alley where drunks urinate. The father and mother are unemployed, the son Ki-woo (Choi Woo-shik) has failed the entrance exam for the South Korean university system, and the daughter Ki-jung (Park So-dan) has failed to get into an art school. They fold pizza boxes for cash. When a friend (Park Seo Joon) tells Ki-woo that the Park teenage daughter Da-hye (Jung Ji-so) needs a tutor, Ki-woo applies for and, with the help of documents forged by his sister, gets the job. Then when he learns that the Park toddler son needs an art therapist for a recent traumatic event, Ki-woo recommends his sister, without disclosing that that she is his sister. (The traumatic event that the boy suffered becomes important later.) With the help of Google, she bluffs her way into obtaining the position. Then Ki-jung figures out how to get the Park family chauffeur fired, and the Kim father Ki-taek (Song Kang-ho) gets the job. Using the cook/housekeeper's (Lee Jung Eun) peach allergy, they manage to get her fired as well, and the Kim mother Chung-sook (Jang Hye-jin) takes her place. By halfway through the film, the Parks are employing all four of the Kims without knowing that they are members of the same family. Complications ensue, of course, and there is a plot twist that I did not seek coming. As a social satire, this film is excellent, although the violent ending seemed incongruent with the rest of the film.","Feb 3, 2020"
9,Lucky people who understand korean!,"Two poor families, one not lucky in money gathering,other one unlucky in social experience. That's what parasites do, they find most vulnerable people, who has no immune developed against them, who never met them before and use their healthy trust. I thought Birdman will be a far leader on the best movie of decade, but this Korean dreamteam jumped to the bus and almost made driver to give up his seat. Lines with preexisting diseases changed after new parasites arrived killed it at the end. Will be waiting for next one with wet lips.","Jan 7, 2020"

9,Truly a blast,"Parasite was such a mesmerizing piece of film. It's storytelling was weird, absurd, unexpected and somehow came together really nicely. It's hard to describe this piece due to how many genre's of film it covers, but throughout the film I've felt like there were multiple layers of metaphors that I was missing. It's not your typical film, that's for sure. All I can say is that you should go in blind, it's worth it.","Sep 5, 2019"

And you will feel eager to what will happen next. It is full of surprises and unexpected twists. I am not a fan of a foreign language movies usually but after watching this movie it was an eye opener. It was a masterpiece! And it always will be one of my recommendations for friends. I rated this movie 9 out of 10. It doesn't bore you while watching and makes you wonder about the ending. A beautiful message is given about that thin line between the poor and the rich. Impressive indeed. I recommend everyone to watch it.","Jul 7, 2023"
9,Brilliant !!!,"NOW THAT'S A MOVIE. Everything from the opening to the closing was quite the spectacle. This is a modern day masterpiece. Masterful Cinematography. Bong's a genius when it comes to building up tension in this film. Everything from color grading, angles, and mise en scene were done with intention, providing a treasure trove of symbolisms that draw up a larger social commentary about the state of poverty in Korea. The best part of this film was its ability to bend genres, serving up comedy and drama so naturally.","May 8, 2020"

9,So stinking good,"I saw this on Hulu and I must say this was definitely worthy of all the critical (haven't seen 1917 and loved Once Upon a time in Hollywood and JoJo Rabbit; 2019 was a verynice movie year)/commercial success it has achieved. Most Americans don't bother with foreign language but hopefully this will help to alleviate that.

9,PARASITE (2019) - 24/02/2020,"Third rewatch later. Hustling poor Korean family demonstrating that the class divide can never be surmounted. A slow-paced thriller that keeps you on edge, whilst never quite becoming sinister, just powerfully developing the characters' stories to the ultimate conclusion. Bong Joon-ho's Parasite might leave you asking who are the real bottom feeders in the black comedy about social structures. There's plenty of food for thought as this picture is deeper than than what it may seem like on the surface.

9,Bong-Kers! But in a great way!,"The hype around Parasite has been huge, and the more i read about it, the more i wanted to see it. A couple of my friends had seen it and knowing they know what i like, urged me not to wait until Feb for its UK Release, but to try and see a preview. Luckily enough, there was a preview at Curzon Mayfair in London this week with director and lead actor introducing it and i managed get a ticket. I can safely say its the best money i have ever invested in watching a film.

The best way to see this is not to know anything about it and try to avoid the spoilers which i managed to do. The Tag line on the poster ""act like you own the place"" had me intrigued, but having seen the film, it makes perfect sense.

Its basically a home invasion movie that has a lot of laughs at the start but then turns very dark. The story is very cleverly told and all the cast act their socks off. There are some real surprises/shocks along the way, but all make the film more entertaining.

Can clearly see why it won the Palme D'or at Cannes, ive seen nothing like it, its in my top 3 of the year and i cannot wait to see it again. Have to say its best to see with a big crowd, as the laughs and gasps that come along the way make it even more enjoyable.","Dec 13, 2019"
9,Very well made,"Just as a flatworm or a tapeworm enters the human body unnoticed, stay in the stomach and starts multiplying to damage the human internal system, a poor family becomes a parasite to a rich peaceful family.

The concept of humans being parasites is superbly told through incredible cinematography, editing and background score.","Sep 19, 2019"
9,One of the years best,"Glad that I watched this movie before the Oscar nominees were announced. I feel a number of people Judge it harshly bcos it won a film over other equally excellent movies

In my opinion it's definitely one of the best movies of 2019-2020.

Excellent performances and a harsh view of people at the bottom

The movie switches very quickly from comedy to drama to violence near end.

Sad open ended finale.

Highly recommend","Feb 11, 2020"
9,One of the Best movies of its Time,"Ok it took me long enough to watch this movie, and o my god what a great movie, I was expecting a lot but wow not this much, the poster told me something different and the movie gave me something different, and I loved it, packed with great acting by all main characters, and great cinematography, and just pure cinema perfection from start to finish, Parasite becomes another of my favorite movies of all time, I wasn't really expecting this, I heard all the people who watched this movie with all the hype, and now I know why. The one thing also that this movie delivers is that you can relate with the characters and drags you until the end, At the end of the day Parasite becomes a non-forgettable film, and will go down as one of the favorite films of all time, I give "" a 9 out of 10 Stars.","Jan 17, 2025"
9,Intelligent and Extraordinary,"Parasite will go down in history as one of the best comedy and international films of the century.The film stars Korean celebrated actor Song Kang-ho as Kim-taek the head of a poor deprived Korean family living in a basement; with his wife and two children. The film tells the story of a poor family living in a basement without access to basic utilities. The head of the family is Mr Kim. He wants the best for the family. But he cant afford the cost of university education for his intelligent son, Kevin and brilliant daughter, Jessica. Min is a friend of Kevin. He also wants the best for his friend. He recommended Kevin to take his place as a tutor. Kevin became the personal tutor of Da-hye, the daughter of a wealthy businessman. Kevin was able to grab this life changing opportunity. First he brought in Jessica as an art teacher. The two worked intelligently and perfectly by bringing in their dad and mum as driver and househelp respectively. But nothing is so perfect in this world. What would happen it comes to knowledge that they are related as family? The film is set in suburbs and high class residential area in a typical Korean city. This gives it the affluence versus poverty touch that underlines the theme of the film. The script was suspenseful and full of excitement. The performance of Song Kang-Ho was spectucular. He blended emotions with intelligence. Directing wise, individual performances raised the bar.Everyone knew what they were doing and delivered with aplomb. The quality of the film's video editing gave it a polishing and glossing visual impressions. However, I was not impressed with the films dialogue. It did less than enough to convey the theme of the film to its audience. Paraite is going to be a film you would not quit watching. It is emotional and funny. No matter how hard life maybe there will always be a time to laugh. And if you want to laugh very well, then I recommend this film for you.","Feb 27, 2020"
9,Another Boon Joon-ho Classic!,"Parasite is so good. The energy of this film is unique with the blend of different styles being both seamless and quirky. I loved the creative choices made here from the direction, to the cinematography, to the production design and the script. It's fresh and so unlike anything we've seen in recent memory.

The way the film builds to that climax is truly masterful. Bravo!","Apr 9, 2022"
9,Awesome film,"Less subtle but much more embodied depiction of social class at where each class lives. A Twist in the second half of film. Dark, funny, thrilling, and thought provoking. This film has all combinations.","Feb 10, 2020"
9,"Make a plan, life will change it...","I didn't know what to expect from Parasite. After a few minutes, I found myself with the same feeling in my gut as the first time I saw Rocky. I was really rooting for this impoverished but street smart, underdog of a family. The story moved forward and I found myself not sure of how I felt about them and their charade. The acting and directing are tremendous! The pace of the film leaves you suspended in anxiety. But what an incredible film it is. Without question one of the best films I've seen in the last five years. Certainly the sleeper film for the Academy Award. Excellent, 9/10.","Feb 9, 2020"
9,Holy Moly! What a ride!!,"I'm a little late to the party but this movie is one hell of a fun picture. I didn't see all of the best picture noms but I see why this won. It's funny, suspenseful, scary, gross, touching and more. The storyline is never boring and it keeps you engrossed the entire time. The writing, cinematography, editing, etc is perfect. Twisty and fun is how I would describe this movie. You would be missing out on a great time if you let the fact you need to read subtitles throughout. I didn't even notice. If this movie were made in America and was made the exact same way everyone would be talking about it. Parasite and Get Out! (My favorite 2018 movie) would make a great double feature night.","Aug 10, 2020"
9,That was Amazing,"Hi everyone I didn't know anything about the story of the movie, the actors, and the awards that this movie won before watching the movie, and I was interested in seeing it only because of the relatively good ratings given by the viewers.

When I saw the movie, I was really involved and I liked the acting of the actors and the narration of the movie

It is rare that you really enjoy and admire a movie after watching it

After watching the movie, I came to the imdb website and did a small review about this movie, and when I saw that it won four Oscars and won and was nominated in dozens of other festivals, it became even more admirable.

I don't want to talk about the details of the story, firstly because it has already been discussed by others, and secondly, you will get the pleasure of seeing it for the first time.

It was very heartwarming and exciting for me.","Dec 27, 2022"
9,Incredibly thought provoking,After watching the film I continued to run the film through my mind. The way the writers put subtle flashes to in your face current social climate issues was probably one of my favorite things about the film. Like other reviews I agree that it's almost two films in one. You will leave with internal questions and possibilities of different ending that could happen.,"Feb 11, 2020"
9,Another Korean gem,"Boon Jong ho's parasite is a slow burner 2hr film telling a story about two families (actually3) whose lives gets entangled within a house. Although the last half hour movie do make out of the lost time initially where the story takes some time for the build up. The mansion has a special eerie feel throughout the film and you will know why it feels like that later on. The background score supports the eerieness. I watched the film in Korean language using eng subtitles edited by a Korean guy who knew only handful of English. So there were scenes where I had to literally assume what had happened by looking at the frame alone. Overall you won't regret watching parasite ,infact it's a must watch for people who likes seeing unpredictable films","Sep 5, 2019"
9,Moral Bankruptcy In A Capitalist World,"Last year we had Shoplifters which gave us a taste of how Japanese capitalism looks like, this year we have Parasite to show what South Korean upper class smugness looks like. Its a well deserved Palme D'or winner and potentially the first Korean film to taste Oscar glory this year.","Aug 31, 2019"
9,"I don't have any negatives for this, it's a brilliant film","Despite hearing about this from day dot, I thankfully managed to avoid knowing anything about this other than it's title, director and subsequent success. Boy am I glad, because it's quite the ride!

No doubt about it, 'Parasite' is a high quality film. It wasn't at all what I had assumed it would be like, it has a much more comedic side to it than I was expecting - and that's a positive. Yet, it's still pretty dark. It's a great mix. The plot is one that is very entertaining to see play out - the ending is particularly nuts.

The cast do a fantastic job, especially the main quartet. Song Kang-ho would be my personal standout, I enjoyed watching him throughout. Choi Woo-shik is very good too, as are Park So-dam and Jang Hye-jin. All of the onscreen talent do terrific though, from Cho Yeo-jeong to Lee Jung-eun.

I don't have any negatives for this, it's a brilliant film. From the cinematography, to the dialogue, to the locations, to the humour. You name it, this produces it on an impressive level.

Not that I need to say this, given I'm seemingly one of the last few who hadn't, but you must watch this!","Nov 1, 2020"
9,Nice movie with different ending,"""Parasite"" is nothing short of a cinematic marvel that masterfully blends dark comedy, suspense, and social commentary into a gripping narrative. Bong Joon-ho's direction is impeccable, with every frame meticulously crafted to enhance the story's depth and complexity. The performances are outstanding, particularly from Song Kang-ho, whose portrayal adds layers of nuance to the already rich characters. The film's exploration of class disparity is both thought-provoking and chilling, leaving a lasting impact long after the credits roll. ""Parasite"" is a must-watch that deserves every accolade it's received-truly a 9-star masterpiece!","Aug 18, 2024"
9,Crazy Poor Asians,After watching this great movie. Somebody ask To describe the in 1 sentence. Lol. That's my review and I'm sticking to it.

9,parasite,"The story is so well balanced between the two families, that you can't even tell who the lead actors or the supporting ones are. It is also one of those very few movies which don't have a Hero-Villain storyline. The way it dealt with social discrimination and flaws in human nature is beyond extraordinary. It clearly explains why it is only the third film in history to win both the Palme d'Or and Academy Award for Best Picture. A rare masterpiece indeed.","Sep 13, 2020"
9,A complete smorgasbord of emotions in this one.,"Was absolutely blown away by this movie. Some scenes had me crying with laughter and some scenes made me sit on edge.

Knew this movie would be good but the storyline is so funny but also so unique and clever and it just keeps getting better and better with larger plot twists. The movie is also quite easy to follow and isnt extremely complex. Had a lot of respect for Korean filmography and this has added to that respect a lot.

Looking forward to see what Bong comes up with next for sure","Sep 29, 2020"
9,Strong 4.5 // Well-oiled Machine,"Wow. A truly exceptional film that somehow lives up to the immense praise. It manages to be so many things at once: an operatic satire, a classist takedown, a cheeky comedy, a twisty thriller, a chilling horror, a somber rumination. Much of the success is owed to the absolutely phenomenal screenplay which is one of the most intricately constructed in recent memory. Every setup is paid off, every tonal shift deftly balanced, every progression carefully timed. The movie feels like a well-oiled machine firing on all cylinders, thrusting you through the densely layered narrative without so much as a hiccup. And perhaps most importantly, despite its highly allegorical nature, the film never compromises on the entertainment value and emotional catharsis of its literal story and characters. It's not often you see a film realize its ambition this resoundingly. Don't miss it.

Strong 4.5/5","Nov 4, 2019"
9,"After 'Parasite's' 4 Oscar wins, Indian fans claim it is inspired by Vijay-starrer 'Minsara Kanna'","The critically acclaimed South Korean film 'Parasite' recently won 4 Oscar awards, namely, Best Screenplay, Best Director, Best Foreign Film and Best Picture. While fans are in awe of the film, many Twitter users from India are now claiming that the film is inspired by Tamil film 'Minsara Kanna' starring Vijay, directed by KS Ravikumar. The films revolve around a poor family who work at a rich family's place in order to survive. While 'Parasite' did amazingly at the box office, 'Minsara Kanna' which was a 1999 release received average reviews.","Feb 15, 2020"
9,Parasite crafts a dark but brilliant story about our society,"This film got a lot of praise going into the Oscars season this year for not only being a commentary of society in the same way Joker does, but doing it through the lens of a Korean family. by doing this it forces the film to have a different feel from any film of its type. Many Americans don't understand the class system of other countries, and getting to see another countries class system being represented on screen gives the film a very different type of feel.

In Korea there are a lot of stricter gun laws that stop people from getting to them so in order to make a kill you would have to use other methods, and that does play a role within the context of this film and adds to the complete and utter fear that can come from it.

There are also a issue for more flooding for the poor in Korea in which this film also addresses in a lot of big and massive ways throughout the film as it becomes the catalyst for why the family makes many of the choices that they choose to make within it.

Parasite really does manage to capture the essence of what truly matters in our society for the poor and the rich and their differences","Apr 7, 2020"
9,A must-watch for all cinephiles out there!!,"A true masterpiece in every area of film-making. Hats-off to the director, writers, the cast and all involved!","Jul 29, 2020"
9,A modern masterpiece,"I watched this on Amazon Prime. I have rated over 3000 movies on IMDb and this is the 5th movie I have given a 10/10 rating. A movie about social standings, somewhere between a Dickensian novel and an Ealing dark comedy movie. It's a long movie but doesn't feel so, the writing is some of the best I've seen in years, the acting is superb and the general feel of the movie is brilliant. A movie to make you laugh, shed a tear and also contemplate. I doubt I will see a better movie for many years.","Sep 27, 2021"
9,"Mesmerizing and Entertaining, Bong Joon-ho delivers a masterpiece!!","Parasite is a black comedy thriller film directed by Bong Joon-ho and stars Song Kang-ho, Choi Woo-shik, Lee Sun-kyun, Cho Yeo-jeong, Park So-dam, Lee Jung-eun, Jang Hye-jin, Park Myung-hoon, Jung Ji-so and Jung Hyeon-jun.

The best part of the movie is it's highly engaging story which will not even give you a reason to blink, the movie has all the ingredients to keep you engaged. The running time of the movie is of two hours but you'll feel that this is the shortest two hours you've ever spent on any movie.

The director has chosen the characters very carefully and each of the characters were just artistically brilliant in the portray of their assigned character. The acting will leave you spell-bounded and the realism in the acting will leave you awestruck.

The screenplay of the movie is brilliant and there are regular shocks and turns with mind boggling twists which will keep increasing the interest in the movie. The climax of the movie describes why Bong Joon-ho is considered one of the greatest directors of his era.

In the end i would like to thank you for trading my review and would suggest to watch this magnificently crafted work of art which will keep you mesmerized and entertained.","Jun 24, 2021"
9,"Dont dismiss it as another foreign boring art-house film, this is very entertaining and deserved of its Oscars","A friend recommended this to me. I was excited to see it as it won Best Picture at the Oscars two years ago, but I was also a little hesitant because I am not the biggest fan of subtitled films and sometimes Oscars simply reward the wrong movies big gold.

Well they got it right this time. In fact the movie is so good that the subtitles certainly didnt bother me and added to my enjoyment of it.

Lots of people I am sure will dismiss this film as a boring flick that the Oscars went nuts over but I say please trust the Academy on this one.

This film is not slow by any means it remains entertaining throughout with very witty dialogue and situations and fine acting.

If you are not a fan of dark humor you may want to skip this one as there is a lot of it but if you are it doesnt get much better than this.

Highly recommended. It doesnt disappoint.","Jun 18, 2021"
9,Vulnerability is inevitable and everybody is dispensable.,"Saw ""Parasite"" yet again and was once again entranced by the movie's brutal depiction of the ramifications of being vulnerable. But vulnerability is inevitable and everybody is dispensable. ""Parasite"" is an allegorical masterpiece and is certainly worth all the hype it has generated over the last few months. I'd highly recommend everyone to see this film and if possible, even sample the Black & White cut of the film. I haven't seen the B&W cut myself but the director says the societal fractures that are depicted in the film are even more evident in the B&W cut. Kudos to Bong-Joon Ho and his team for conjuring up this splendidly bitter tonic. If you have seen and loved ""Parasite"", watch Jordan Peele's ""Us"".","Feb 28, 2020"
9,A more of the director,"This director is one of the best in Korea, one of how many jewels more than this is the best of all. Memories of a killer or the host are also very good. In addition to the way it is carried in whether several generos as a comedy moment, suspense, tension is a unique expectancy.","Sep 21, 2021"
9,Pleasantly disturbing,"Watched on a flight after the Oscars. Curious. It starts slow, there are subtitles, but you are quickly adapted to the the films rhythym. I know nothing of this culture but it is a story of humans The loyalty and love we share in our family. Choices are made, levers tripped, situations develop... Both families are endearing. There are some light and humorous scenes. There are also a few 'oh come on' risks akin to a sitcom, but that's how we get from there to 'holy crap what is happening here' so must take that leap with the director. The cinematography is beautiful, the pace is good but you need to pay attention. the dialogue is all valuable- When we get to the last third, it all comes together quickly. Enjoy the ride. You haven't seen a film like this before","Jan 22, 2020"
9,WORTHY!,"It's worthy of your time. No wonder its director won an Oscar, he did a great job. Also, you won't find a minute to be distracted or bored. One thing remains unsubtle, for me, I didn't get satisfied with the ending.","Mar 1, 2020"
9,"'PARASITE' : Full of twists, quirks, shocks and dark humour! An Absolute Must-See.","My Rating : 9/10

Believe me, you are in for a ride!

It's weirdly engaging and oddly satisfying - I love my thrillers and 'Parasite' certainly didn't disappoint. I highly recommend people to avoid knowing anything before going in, because trust me it will add to your experience.

What stood out for me personally was the acting from every cast member, the superb cinematography and the most laugh-out-loud hilarious infusion of humour and superbly crafted comedic, sad and horrific moments juxtaposed so as to play with the emotional state of the viewer in a most artistic way only a skilful filmmaker like Bong Joon-Ho can.

All in all, technical mastery From Mr. Bong Joon-Ho. A Must-See Korean Black Comedy! This film is a milestone for Korean cinema.","Sep 11, 2019"
9,Fiercely Original,"One of the things I liked about the film ""12 Years a Slave"" was that it punctured the idea of the ""happy slave."" Some slaves had the luck to experience better living conditions than others, but none of them was ever allowed to forget that they were property. If they had a ""nice"" master, they might smile and exchange pleasantries, but the seething resentment of having a master in the first place never went away.

A variation on the ""happy slave"" concept still exists in the world of today, I think, but it's been transferred to the serving class. There's this pervasive notion that those who struggle economically are happy just to be employed by those who have more. Maids, nannies, chauffeurs, doormen -- what do they exist for but to make life more convenient for the wealthy, and as long as they're well treated and paid for their efforts, what do they have to complain about?

This dynamic is explored explosively in ""Parasite."" It's almost impossible to talk about the film without revealing its secrets, and this is one film that works best the less you know about it. It's funny, scary, suspenseful, sad, sometimes all at the same time. It's playful, yet serious. Director Bong Joon Ho clearly has a ball playing with genres and constantly upending our expectations. The fun of this movie is never knowing where it's going to go next. It creates a metaphor for the increasing divide between the haves and have nots in Korea specifically but the world in general by presenting us with a filthy rich family that remains blithely unaware of those who, in their eyes, exist to do things for them, even when those people are (literally) right under their feet. There aren't good guys or bad guys, heroes or villains. At times you despise everyone in the movie, at other times you feel compassion for almost all of them. It's a movie that is many things at once and refuses to be categorized, and as a result it looks much like our modern world.

Grade: A","Oct 23, 2019"
9,Social satire on steroids,"Bong Joon-ho's Parasite is perfectly written, filmed, and played - a bit too much at times (did we need this Ri Chun-hee's impersonation, or was that a bonus for Western audiences?).

No spoilers, but you're forced to understand the gimchi will somehow hit the fan, to want to know, among all possible worst case scenarios, which one will prevail, and to enjoy the ever darker humor first permeating, then overflowing this over the top gem.

If this brilliant epic echoes Im Sang-soo's 'The Housemaid' & Kim Ki-duk's '3 iron', Bong remains a league of his own.","Jun 2, 2019"
9,An incredible movie,"The twists and turns to the last minute! An accurate depiction of people's characters with all the good and evil and the sense of survival. I was absolutely taken by surprise and my stomach got turned toward the end, but all part of a very realistic storyline. Definitely worth watching. I will do so again once the effect of the first time-round has subsided. Brilliant work.","Mar 15, 2020"
9,A very rewarding experience,"Love to see movies that are different than what comes out of USA studios, and this one was unique and fresh. After seeing it I have added Seoul as my next destination, it just will not happenduring rainy season. 🤣

This film showed that life is not so different around the world. For example the way the rich folk in this film looked on the downtrodden folk; it reminded me of life in 1970s when I grew up in South America.

Yes it merits the awards it received at the Oscars.","Feb 15, 2020"

9,Brilliantly staged satire by Bong Joon Ho,"""Parasite"" directed by Bong Joon Ho is a fine film about one horrible family taking horrendous advantage of the wealthy Park family, and a strong message to our global culture.

I was deeply impressed by this gem of a film, which only strengthens the creative vision of Bong, as well as the fascinating cinema of South Korea.

Fantastic direction - Bong Joon Ho is a master at building suspense from simple scenes and shots. Formidable cinematography. A sovereign effort in production design. Deliberate and effective pacing throughout. Taking all this together with a very interesting script and characters, and an excellent film is realised.

Highly recommendable.","Sep 10, 2019"
9,No plan !,"You know what kind of plan never fails ? No plan . No plan at all , You know why ? Because life cannot be planned . . . With no plan , nothing goes wrong . And if something spins out of control , it doesn ' t matter , Even if the country gets destroyed or sold out , nobody cares . Get it ? This line of this movie stuck in my mind. It's like saying if the destiny choice you to be poor accept it don't ever bend your destiny to go with your demands or else you lose it all even the good things that been shadows out by life minority like freedom and love.","Dec 29, 2019"
9,Watched 4 times in 48 hours,"Each time I watched Parasite I picked up something new Movie will grip you and keep hold of you until the end. Very deep, meaningful story of 2 Korean families at near opposite ends of sociology-economic spectrum. Amazing how much they have in common, however their differences are brought to life by the director in painful scenes, imagery, and tons of symbolism.

A must watch.","Nov 22, 2021"
9,One of the best films of the past decade,"The film Parasite follows the story of a South Korean family living day to day in desperate measures to find steady work but by sheer luck and manipulative tactics they are able to find work with a family who are living their dream life of riches. This Tragicomedy captivates you till the very end and that's a rarity in today's era without the blinding use of CGI and fast paced super hero movies. I thought maybe the Oscars were hyping this movie up but it truly deserved all the awards it got and shows true craftsmanship in its screenplay, cinematography, character development, acting, and so much more.","Feb 29, 2020"
9,The way of story telling is the soul of this master piece by Bong,"Performance: Both Kim and Park family members did brilliant job in their role. Kim family was full of cunning and witty one however Park family was simple and soft one. Both family depicted their side perfectly.

Direction: Bong is the captain of this dark comedy with lots of thriller. Just like he baked dark comedy cinema as a cake and added thriller like a cherry on the top of the cake. Execution matters a lot when you are talking about top quality cinema and this is one of them.

Script: This is the main USP of this movie. Although this movie available in the English subtitle, still you are able to relate and enjoy this cinema completely. Great showcase of the difference between elite class and poor people. Some small object played pivot role e.g. Smell, Morse Code

Background Score: As movie flow, background score provided perfect combination to it. For this genre, great background score is key to entertain the audience.

Last Words: Don't miss it otherwise isme tera ghata.","Feb 16, 2020"

9,A good watch,Great film very well put together and very much takes an unexpected turn.,"Jun 9, 2021"
9,A brilliantly-executed film,"It's a comedy tragedy set in modern Seoul, South Korea. It follows the intersection between a poor but conniving family and a wealthy, aloof family.

Kim Ki-taek (Song Kang-ho) is a poor entrepreneurial type with many failed plans. He lives in a disheveled basement apartment with his wife, Chung-sook (Jang Hye-jin), son, Ki-woo/Kevin (Choi Woo-shik), and daughter, Ki-jung/Jessica (Park So-dam). Ki-woo's university friend prompts him to take over the English tutoring of the high school daughter of a wealthy tech entrepreneur.

Park Dong-ik (Lee Sun-kyun) is an entrepreneur who lives in a lavish architect-designed house with his flighty wife, Choi Yeon-gyo (Cho Yeo-jeong). She is a hypochondriac and unable to control their young son, Da-Song (Jung Hyeon-jun). Da-Song is the only character who sees through all the chaos. The Park daughter, Da-hye (Jung Ji-so), flirts extravagantly with Kevin. We also meet Park's housekeeper, Gook Moon-gwang (Lee Jung-eun), chauffeur, and a later character that plays an important role.

The film follows the Kim family's successful attempt to ingratiate itself as various staff members for the Park family, the impact of this success on the Kim family's self-perception, and the great drama that unfolds when the original housekeeper returns to take care of some ""unfinished business."" The first 3/4 of ""Parasite"" is a comedic commentary about social class; the last 1/4 takes a 180-degree violent turn in its continuing class analysis.

""Parasite"" is a brilliantly-executed film. All the characters are excellent, though the Kim son and daughter lose a bit of their mojo after they successfully the Park world. The script pacing is superb, and the jarring turn the film takes towards the end makes sense in the context.","Jun 22, 2023"
9,Superb!,"Funny, Dark, Weird, Wonderful, Predictable, unpredictable.

This movie literally had everything!

I was't even sure I could do two hours + of subtitles, but it was easy in the end. Nice fast pace, bits of humour and bits of darkness.

Nothing not to like, whatever genre of picture you prefer.","Mar 5, 2020"
9,Don't Miss It,"This is my second viewing of Parasite and it's just as good as the first time I saw it a few months ago. It's been winning lots of awards and deservedly so. Ki-taek and his family live in a dingy basement and struggle to make ends meet, but when they see an opportunity to insinuate themselves into the wealthy Park family they devise a plan that, at first, is working like a charm. It's very amusing and with great performances, and you'll be surprised by the conclusion. This Korean film is about family and class division, and no matter how good a plan you have you can't plan for the unexpected. Parasite is the well deserved winner of the Palme d'or at last year's Cannes Film Festival.","Feb 3, 2020"
9,Oscar well deserved,"Starting 2004, I watched hundreds of K-movies, literally. Closer to 1,000 than 500, actually. Halfway into ""Parasite"", I was certainly entertained, but still wondering why this particular movie won this year's Oscar for best motion picture. Then I stopped wondering. Well deserved win! A few others would have been worthy contenders (""Oldboy"", "" Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter... and Spring"", ""Bad guy"", ""A bittersweet life"" or ""3-Iron"" come to my mind and I forgot many others), but I guess Korean movies weren't on the radar until the mid-2010's. Better late than never...","Feb 23, 2020"
9,One of the best movies of 2019,"This is without a doubt one of the best movies I saw in 2019. The story is so original, it's funny, it's strange, but it could really happen.","Dec 2, 2019"
9,Best film of 2019,"A great movie. Not a dull moment. What a great script , acting and directing. Probably one of the most original and entertaining film I've seen in many years. A tragedy wrapt up in a comedy genre.","Feb 5, 2020"
9,Excellent,Best storyline I have seen in a long time. Great acting. Would definitely recommend seeing.,"Feb 29, 2020"
9,Brilliant Dark Satire,"Parasite: A con-artist family preys on an upper-class couple and their children. That's the bare bones of this film but it is a multi-layered black comedy thriller which heaps the satire on with a trowel but never falters as the brilliant script and direction by Bong Joon-ho keeps things going at a brisk canter. A tale of class war as the condescension shown to the servants is all too obvious, there is a line which must never be crossed by the hired help. The way the Kim family inveigle their way into the wealthy Park's home is a joy to observe. First the son as an English tutor then the daughter as an art therapist followed by the father and mother as chauffeur and housekeeper, the existing servants just cast aside. Something odd then happens which would be a spoiler if revealed but it alters the tone of the film. Things proceed towards a dark climax which ventures into the area of quotidian horror. Another masterpiece by Bong Joon-ho which he (partially) based on his own experiences as a maths tutor to the son of a well off family. 9/10.","Jan 26, 2020"
9,"""They are nice because they are rich.""","The trailer to this movie does not give anything away, and that makes me super happy because wow, this movie caught me off guard. Beautiful cinematography, intense moments and a great cast. Also I need a bowl of ram-don... NOW!","May 30, 2021"
9,.........and I thought I wouldn't like it.....,"I watched this movie as I had heard great reviews about it. I don't normally go for movies with subtitles as I find them difficult to watch and read at the same time, however, I thoroughly enjoyed it! I wasn't sure of the plot and had made a point of not reading up on it before I watched it. I was not disappointed! I do enjoy something a bit different, and this delivered. A bit of suspense, horror and a touch of humour, highly recommended.","Nov 8, 2020"
9,Awesome,Loved it. Everyone should watch this movie. Had our attention the entire movie. Bit strange and unexpected. So good. Just so good,"Apr 11, 2020"
9,A Masterpiece in every sense of the word,"First of all , i Just wanna say that ""Memories of Murder"" is Still My Favorite Joon-ho Bong Film, But that doesn't Make this any less of a masterpiece in my Book, Definitely One of the best films of this decade,what a superb Mix of comedy and tragedy, Happiness and Sadness, joy and sympathy.","Aug 14, 2019"
9,What a great movie,Shakespearean story. Engaging. Masterfully moving between light and heavy themes and scenes. I was on the edge of my seat the entire time. Truly exceptional movie. A Must see.,"Jan 9, 2022"
9,My FIRST subtitled film.,"I was very hesitant about watching this movie and it exceeded my expectations more then I thought it would. I understood the premise from hearing others discuss the film. I watched the trailer countless times (You did your job Ads) and I still had refused to watch it, until my boyfriend suggested it (The things we do for love).

Needless to say I was very glad to have included this in my list of films I've watched. This movie gave me every emotion you could possibly get. I felt shocked, angered, comical, sorrowful, the list goes on!

I would definitely recommend this movie to all movie lovers who want to feel a grasp through their screen.","Jan 10, 2021"

9,"""You can't go wrong with no plans""","I feel like I've said this a lot this year, but no matter the quality of the finished product, if I can confidently walk out of the theater and feel genuinely thrilled that I experienced that film in a theater, it's an achievement on its own. In today's ever changing streaming world, it's important to keep the theater experience alive. Parasite does that immensely well. Captivating, thought-provoking, unsettling, but above all entertaining, Parasite is one of the most unique films of the year. Much like Get Out a few Oscar seasons ago, Parasite manages to reach a wide audience with its shocking direction, while also broadening the scope of your brain through its incredible intelligence in storytelling. I'm not completely sure how I feel about the last 20 minutes, otherwise this could be flirting with a 10/10.

9.1/10","Nov 4, 2019"
9,Great allegory,"I predict a strong hard campaign to make this South Korean movie become a hype until to get its deserved Oscar. The allegory is pretty awesome. I recommend to get a blindly watch, because this could be very useful. I'm gonna pay attention more on next Joon-ho Bong's projects.","Oct 31, 2019"
9,Parasite,Holy crap this movie surprised me a lot. At first the movie seemed more of the tone of a mild comedy with not much of suspense happening. But then holy shiz nuggets it starts to get more tense and then so much crap happens at once. I can see why this won best picture. I was engaged and no moment was dull. It really sets how unequal classes of the rich and poor are and the truth of it just hits hard when you realize it. Please watch it is a must!,"Sep 30, 2020"
9,A metaphorical pun,"It was a great movie, a metaphorical pun intended to show the differences and/or similarities between the two major classes of the society, i.e. the rich and the poor. It has an extravagant climax which will not be liked by majority. However, the climax was justified afterwards. It was a great drama. I enjoyed watching it. Once the movie gears the pace, it was impossible to leave your seat without watching it full at one go.","Jan 21, 2020"
9,Just Great!!,"Parasite doesn't give a s... about following rules, sticking to the plan or pleasing the viewer The storyline is thoroughly thought, the characters deeply developed and the element of surprise is constantly around the corner during the second half of the movie. One of the best movies i ve ever seen","Oct 29, 2019"
9,I love it!,"Bong Joon-ho, a distinguished filmmaker from South Korea, won the prestigious 'Palme d'Or' award at the Cannes Film Festival this year, for his latest film, Parasite. This movie explores class disparity and criticizes late capitalism.

Bong is known for his unique style and has directed acclaimed films such as Memories of Murder and Snowpiercer. Parasite continues this trend by presenting a narrative that is full of unexpected twists. The story revolves around the Kim family, who are struggling to make ends meet while living in a dim basement and dealing with unemployment. They survive by leeching off neighboring coffee shops' Wi-Fi and folding pizza boxes for money. When a local fumigator visits to spray the streets, the Kims exploit the opportunity, deliberately leaving their windows open in hopes of eliminating pests in their midst.

The eldest son, Ki-woo, starts tutoring the wealthy Da-hye under the guise of ""Kevin,"" which leads to a series of deceptions. Through Ki-woo's cunning, each family member secures employment with the affluent Parks, assuming distinct roles: the sister as an art teacher, the father as the chauffeur, and the mother as the housekeeper. Gradually, the Kims infiltrate the Parks' household.

At first, the film is like a comedy of manners, with the audience cheering for the Kims as they outwit the Parks. However, the Parks are not your typical wealthy family; they live in opulence, wear lavish attire, and complain about trivial matters. Beneath this facade, the film reveals their astonishing naivety and blissful ignorance of their reliance on the invisible working class. This obliviousness magnifies their despicability, challenging conventional perceptions of privilege.

While the film does not absolve the Kims of their conniving actions, it raises poignant questions about their ability to truly assimilate into the upper class. Ki-woo's question to Da-hye - ""In this setting, do I fit in?"" - prompts contemplation on the feasibility of social mobility when the impoverished are forced to compete among themselves for survival, while the wealthy remain oblivious to societal issues.

Despite its rich social commentary, Parasite remains thoroughly engaging and avoids the pitfalls of didacticism. The film shifts seamlessly between family drama, comedic satire, and suburban horror, skillfully dissecting the exploitative relationship between social classes. It dares to challenge viewers to confront their fascination with opulent lifestyles while ignoring the harsh social realities that sustain them. Parasite emerges as a biting and timely commentary that aptly encapsulates the concluding decade of the 2010s.","Jan 11, 2024"
9,a true masterpiece,"Plot is perfect. there is just no flaw that is even slightly noticed. acting of all cast members are good. music accompanies scenes very well. the movie covers all genres without making any too much. funny, touching, suspending, sexual, family moments are all there, even horror ones. what left in your mind is a subtle yet powerful message about class discrimination in Korea. It truly deserves the Oscar without needing to employ politics or racial issues.","Jan 17, 2021"
9,Parasite checks ALL of the boxes,"With Parasite, director Bong Joon Ho has served up over two hours of fascinating story played out by interesting characters on beautifully crafted sets. At no point during those two hours did my attention wander, but at several junctures I realized that my pulse was racing (in a very good way).

As with any film - ""your mileage may vary"" - but I cannot imagine that many folks would not enjoy Parasite. It's fantastic.","Apr 23, 2020"
9,Watch the movie it speaks for itself!,"Well what can I say, Boong Joon-Ho is truly delivering here a masterpiece of cinema screenwriting and directing. This is an interesting, humorous and intense experience surely not to miss.

You forget this is even a Korean film as you get vacuumed into a world of it's own - you won't be disappointed!!","Jan 22, 2020"
9,A thrilling ride in a fancy household,"I thoroughly enjoyed seeing this movie on the big screen!

The suspense of an entire family trying to weasel their way into service of a rich family is just the top layer of this movie about life choices, social class and the depths of what you're willing to do for your family.","Sep 23, 2019"
9,Superb Commentary on Class and Inequality,"The smell of being poor is hard to scrub off. Mr Kim and his resourceful and conniving family are working on it, but its engrained right in there. They come up with a plan to infiltrate a wealthy household and live vicariously through them. First, his son, then his daughter, then his wife and, finally, him end up working for the upper-class Park family. Their plan is simple: recommend each other to the nervous mistress of the household, while spreading mistrust about the existing staff. It's a plan which works perfectly.

Bong Joon Jo's narrative, humour, incredibly beautiful and thoughtful direction is deserving of every plaudit it's received. The film just oozes intelligence, conscience and is masterclass in filmmaking. But equally as important is the casting-there isn't a passenger in this film. So-dam Park as Ki Jung, the daughter, Woo-ski Choi as Ki Woo, the son, and Lee Jeong-eun, the mother, are stand out, for me.

The social commentary about class in this film is worth taking the time to watch it, even if it wasn't so thoughtfully entertaining. If this is the quality of Korean cinema, then keep them coming.","Apr 26, 2021"
9,People were bored by this?,"Yes, that's a question i put up to people saying they were bored and talking all trash about the movie. It's by far the best movie I've seen in a foreign language. The plot twist and the twisted end is worth it. If this doesn't satisfy movie watchers, god knows what will.","Apr 12, 2020"
9,Movie of the year,"This film is completely out of the box, a social critic that doesn't choose sides. An absolutely brilliant masterpiece that takes us to a roller coaster of emotions with some kind of new cinematographic genre, that shudder and leave us groundless in a state of deep reflection about the model of society in which we live in. For those looking for an innovative film, with an unusual style, and with a necessary and relevant reflexion, Parasite is the right and the better choice. Impressive work by the director.","Feb 4, 2020"

9,Parasite redefining the 'diversity' debate.,"If Parasite would have come 5-6 years ago, it would have walked out of the Dolby Theater with just a single win in the foreign category and it would have burned my heart. I mean if you can't go beyond that cliched appreciation (of the best foreign-language film), despite touching such high artistic note of story-telling. And that too, just because of a mild language barrier and the politically driven format of Academy and other award shows, as a matter of fact.","Feb 11, 2020"
9,Brilliantly written,"Everything about the movie is great and fun to watch. Plot,acting and whole stuff are unexpectedly good. Gives you chills and laughs at the same time, reminds me of 'Get Out' . 10/10 would recommend.","Dec 15, 2019"
9,Amazing movie!!,This movie has all the emotions. A must watch! The story is so simple yet so twisted. One of the best foreign movies I've watched.,"Apr 19, 2020"
9,One-Line Review: Parasite (9 Stars),"The sudden uproar at the 95th minute of Parasite, a poignant story about a poor family of four living it up through unfair and illicit means and invisibly enjoying the riches of an affluent family of four living in a tony neighborhood, made me stop sipping from my cup of hot water and stare at it, thinking how can a bunch of people create such a moving film that does not stop at one or two messages but delivers this funny yet sad thing called life in its entirety. TN.","Oct 2, 2019"
9,Equal parts of every emotion - so simple yet so complex,"PARASITE was the most unique movie I saw in 2019. (The Lighthouse, High Life, and The Beach Bum came close but this took the cake). It was kind of like a mushroom trip, mentally, in the sense that it manages to make you feel a little bit of every single type of emotion without diving fully into any of them. It manages to weave in and out and being humorous, intriguing, and disturbing consistently, and somehow seamlessly, all while somehow feeling very simple and extremely complex at the same time. It's a film that is fully progressive in a structural sense. And it leaves you with the right amount of minor questions and wonders. Quite a fascinating and accomplished movie - worthy of the hype for sure. This BONG JOON HO is truly a crafty movie-smith. His THE HOST was my favorite film of 2006 upon seeing it, OKJA was a lot of fun a couple of years back, and this easily lives up to those two, if not surpasses them. This is not a movie I could watch over and over again because it is very much a producer of slow-burning anxiety, yet it is a near-masterpiece, if not a thorough one. Recommended.","Nov 28, 2019"
9,"A Disturbing Masterpiece with a Message to human kind to behave as a HUMAN , ( B+ Movie) My Ratings 9/10","This movie is pure art. The subtle theme becomes entangled with the characters' lives and relationships.

9,"It was very unsettling for me, but go watch it","I really appreciated the film. The director was subtle but his end result was strong and intense. It made me very uncomfortable. I probably would not watch it again, but it is worth watching. Acting was without a doubt great.","Sep 13, 2019"
9,It's nature.,"This film shows humanity in all its glory. We can try to claim the rich are evil and the poor deserve better but these are delusions we create to make us feel better. People are terrible. They are selfish. They are greedy. They are unkind. It's part of human nature. No matter how much you have, or how little, humanity still exists, and humanity is the problem.

All the problems in the world that make us suffer day to day are caused in the end because we are human. Nothing we can do about it.

The movie was good. Lol.","Jan 14, 2020"
9,Fantastic!,"I love this movie! At first, I wasn't sold and then it got into this pace and doesn't slow down. Watch this movie!","Feb 9, 2020"
9,The hype is justified.,"I'm a little biased in that I've seen all of Bong Joon-ho's movies and have a heart for Korean cinema in general, but I can say without bias that this movie delivers on the hype. I'll be honest I was avoiding this as I kinda knew going in it was probably going to be depressing and horrifying. There's a running theme in the cinephile community that Korea has it's genre of film, unique unto itself. In Hollywood, films often go through 5 or more drafts that start with big amorphic ideas and edge closer toward crowd pleasing sometimes until they're just 90 minute commercials for the lead actors career. Korean film seems to lack that filter of cost X audience X test screening -+ = blah blah blah. They take big ridiculous ideas and drive them towards the powerful nebulous first draft finish line no matter how emotional draining or traumatic. In a word, Korean cinema can be very ""dark"".

Bong Joon-ho has a special talent for creating 4 dimensional characters, larger than the circumstances in the film and when the payoff comes for them it's likely to cause heart palpitations.

Parasite is a film about grifters who invade a rich family's home, but this is no simple film about ""Oh no when will the family figure them out!?"". This is far bigger and far more shocking. Obviously it's an amazing movie. This little blurb is more here to be a warning. Gird your heart strings when heading into this.","Feb 14, 2020"
9,Whose the parasite and whose the cow?!,"What an amazing film! Clearly an essay on the class divide. Writing lovable but nasty people is tough, but perfectly executed here.

They quite clearly cross the line, and when I mean ""they"" I mean bother the working class and the upper class. You could easily argue that ""parasite"" refers to one family trying to suck another family dry. Or that the upper class is draining the labour of the lower class, and expecting them to be grateful about it too! There is also something about the American Indian theme, a metaphor for dying cultural traditions which are being replaced by modernity? Nature is dog eat dog? Or is it a homage to an ""idyllic"" past where Native American culture was relatively classless?

Either way a must watch if you can handle subtitles!","Aug 17, 2019"
9,Family Absurd Horror at its snarkiest,I watched this film not expecting much but the way it developed a sense of dread and anxiety crept in. The film masterfully builds up and quietly holds the underlying tension and by the end it explodes in everyone's face leaving you gasping for air having held it for a longest time wondering what will happen next. I eventually realized I was watching a subversive horror flick set in a beautiful house with secrets between the walls and what desperation can achieve when unhinged. And my mind was blown when the third act went bongkers haha. I watched this film 3 weeks ago. And still trying to figure out what it all meant. Don't miss it.,"Jul 14, 2019"
9,Real life emotions dramatized,"I didn't feel long at all of the movie as the plot was so grabbing. Despite the dramatic shifts on plots and the human characters, I very much related to the human side of things. Big Kudos to the entire team on every aspect!","Apr 11, 2020"
9,About class boundaries and human division,"Ever since his first film, director Bong Joon-ho has been interested in class divide. And nowhere is this more apparent and poignant than in Parasite, where a low-class family of four, down on their luck, infiltrate an upper class household, each posing as a separate helper. One is a tutor to their daughter, another a driver, and so forth.

And that alone would be plenty entertaining and fascinating. Each of the four members of the Kim family are a fully realized character, brimming with personality, hopes and aspirations. Sure, what they're doing is questionable and even immoral, but the film is told from their point of view and you can't really hate them for trying to reach for those stars. It's not like they're hurting anyone. Initially.

But then the story takes a turn and suddenly it's deadly serious, fiercely intense and full of high stakes and suspense. Before that twist, Parasite was already a great film, but afterwards it became a masterpiece.

It also helps that Bong is a splendid director. Each scene, each shot, is measured, beautiful and poignant. The whole film look amazing, but I especially enjoyed the scenes where heavy rain is falling. Such an impactful scene. For the rich, it's just a night of rain drumming their roof. Kind of relaxing, actually. They don't have to worry about it. But for the poor, it's a night of nightmares, floods and loss. For them, it's the end of their lives as they knew it.

Parasite earned it's Best Picture Oscar and I'm so glad that the Academy is finally acknowledging these foreign films. It's a film full of heavy themes, brilliant acting moments and enough content to keep you wondering for weeks. Heavily recommended.","Mar 10, 2020"
9,"Different approach to cinema, storytelling, editting and basically fresh voice.","This movie left me thinking and analysing it for hours after I left cinema. I had long discussions about days after I've watched. It's fresh approach to making movies. With great emotional punchline.

I'm happy I've seen it.","Apr 13, 2020"
9,Deserves every single award of it...,"I already have a good experience of korean movies, and this one has surely been one of my favourite, though to be honest, having a vague idea of what its plot is about when i decided to watch it, i was not that certain of what i could expect since films dealing according to critics and reviews with allegories and social messages always face my instinctive mistrust. Well, these elements are there too, but all slipped and fitted in a very intriguing and solid storyline which though starting as a light, almost comedian style plot, ends up in a bloodshed and furthermore in a very bitter truth, the realworld truth which is too hard to break free from. The film will capture your interest and attention within its first five minutes and this attention will be constantly increasing throughout its duration, a feature rather typical in this kind of stories where a rather insignificant and innocent act leads to a complicated and difficult to deal with situation like in many Cohen brothers films. Taking this in consideration one could say that the twist of this story is not that original after all, however this one, resulting in an escalating complication and a very bitter ending, is really irresistible, and certainly one of the best and most indriguing one you should expect from a movie! P.S Yesterday, global celebration of the Day of Greek language under the motto: ""Do you know you speak Greek?"". So, here's the tip of the day: Did you know that among plenty of others in your own whichever language, the title of this movie too, is actually a 100% greek word?","Feb 11, 2020"
9,If you love cliché stories this movie is not for you.,"I was not expecting that much of this movie. Normally the films nominated for the Oscars are not my favorites, but I saw something different in PARASITE that take me out of the typical Hollywood movie, the script is very original, and the Oscar is well deserved: you don't expect what is next.

This movie can be labeled as black comedy, thriller, and drama. Is also an ""out of the box"" movie, not for all tastes, I recommend to the audience to expect little and then you´ll be surprised by the script. Finally, I have to say that I am glad that the quality of movies outside the US has been improving so other countries can enrich the 7th Art.","Feb 21, 2020"
9,"Superb: funny, dark, intriguing and profound","A poor South Korean family lives in a ramshackle semi-basement apartment and gets by on hustles and cons. One day the son manages to get a job tutoring the child of a wealthy family. He sees an opportunity to get his parents and sister jobs in the household too. Soon all of them of are in and life is looking much rosier. Then fate throws them a curveball.

Superb. Written and directed by Bong Joon Ho who gave us the superb crime-drama Memories of Murder plus the entertaining Snowpiercer, Parasite is a great mix of comedy and drama, pathos and social commentary.

It starts off in very entertaining fashion as we meet the family that are experts in cons and manipulation. It is quite funny and initially they just seem like slackers. However, after a while it is quite awe-inspiring to see the work that goes into their deceptions.

As the movie progresses it becomes darker and darker. The plot takes on a few surprising twists and turns and the two families involved become symbols of a class divide. The social commentary is thought-provoking without being preachy or seeming biased. Powerful ending.

Solid performances round out an excellent plot and great direction.","Feb 1, 2020"
9,Great movie... Very complex.,"This sort of reminds me of a mix between comedy and drama. I understand that parts were meant to be funny and because of the difference in culture and sub titles, lots of the humor was lost on me but I could tell that some parts were meant to be funny. It was all very interesting and kept me wondering what was going to happen next. I thought this was a horror movie and it is not at all. More of a tradegy and social commentary. The smell didn't register with me either untill nearly the end but it was a great plot device.","Jan 18, 2020"
9,Make any plan is an all-time joke.,"The film is a contemporary cinamatic adaptation of the Sisyphus myth. You will even find the stone, symbolically appearing at many scenes.","Jan 16, 2020"
9,A fully deserving Oscar winner,"In all honesty I'd been putting this off for quite a while. After watching it I can see exactly why it won so many awards. The entire film is a fantastic view of the class divide. The symbolism used throughout is amazing. The comedy is perfectly timed and the tension that is built in certain scenes (spoiler free) is some of the best I've seen.

This film has made me visit the back catalogue of Bong Joon-Ho and with the exception of Snowpiecer (2013) I have not been disappointed.

Overall, if you are a film fan then you NEED to watch this... and the rest of his films","Mar 12, 2021"

(Note Mr Trump: in Korean with subtitles, but easy to follow subtitles!) I don't want to add any spoilers, so I'm restricting my comments. This is a story of a poor, struggling clever family that manage to inveigle their way into a wealthy family's life. The plot goes well until...","Feb 28, 2020"
9,A comedy without clowns and a tragedy without villains,"Writer/director Bong Joon Ho (""The Host"" ""Snowpiercer"" ""Okja"") has been on a roll of late with thought provoking genre films with underlying social commentary. From river monsters, to end-of-the-world tales, to a pig-like Totoro, Bong is not afraid to take seemingly popcorn concepts and work them into a smart film that has arthouse and movieplex crossover appeal. With ""Parasite"" he takes a more subtle route and tells the story of a struggling family living in a tiny basement hovel in South Korea where they have to leech off neighbors unprotected wifi and deal with nightly public urination outside their alley-side windows. When the son lands a job as a tutor for the daughter of a rich family by pretending to be a college student and lying about his resume, he spots an opportunity to recommend his sister as an art teacher for the younger brother, hiding that she's his sister and lying about her credentials as well. Next the brother and sister scheme to get the chauffeur fired so their dad can land the job and then how to fire the longtime housekeeper so their mom can snatch that opening. To tell more would spoil the fun, but I will say the film takes an unexpected turn and dramatic shift in tone. I had no idea where the film was going or how it was going to end and the ultimate ending is quite a shocker. What's most interesting about the film is asking the question, who really is the parasite? Is it the lower class family living off the rich family host or is it this privileged rich family living off the backs of their working class servants? The answer is that it could be either or most likely both. Bong's thesis appears to be that this situation of haves and have-nots coexisting is untenable and will lead to an inevitable collision course, much as it happened in his prior film ""Snowpiercer."" Bong sums it up best himself when he was described ""Parasite"" as ""a comedy without clowns, a tragedy without villains."" If I had a complaint about the film it's that the shift from humorous satire to something darker felt a bit incongruous, but Bong likely did this intentionally to bolster the film's message around the inevitable conclusion of a world of stark haves and have-nots. ""Parasite"" is a compelling film that delivers a pure cinematic experience, meaning that it's a story that could not have been told in any other medium, and is an absolute treat for cinema lovers.","Apr 28, 2020"
9,Masterwork,"It is demonstrably an excellent film within the first 15 minutes and it gets better. It has a very good script, one which is honed with good characterization and motive, together with fine structural exposition. No other script in the 2020 Oscars has the qualities that this one has in terms of writing skill.

In terms of execution, the directing and other technical components, all coalesce brilliantly. It is probably the editing too where so many remarkable films excel that lifts the film again. The sequences in the house between the families are memorable here as the tension is raised with so much at stake.

The story has many layers which are relevant to this time: chiefly inequality, but also other themes too which are touched on in deft ways and through the characters so as to move the story along toward its rather terrible conclusion. The ending is somewhat classical; a purge clarifies the entire drama, and it is effective in its own terms, but it also the only part of script that is not entirely ideal. Other choices might have been made which do not make the one we see an error.

Signalling 'wokeness' is pointless with this film. It is a very good film and will be referenced by film makers and students for years to come. That durability is honor indeed.","Feb 10, 2020"
9,Amazing Screenplay,Apart from the great cinematography what overwhelmed me about this movie is its screenplay. The movie follows a continuity of speed and all the way keeps the humour intact. The dark satirical comedy which is funny but after every laugh it also pins a thought about the actual darkness which creates the humour and it lingers for sometime. A movie for all genre lovers.,"Jan 17, 2020"
9,Tonal tightrope.,"'Parasite (2019)', like many South Korean efforts I've seen, essentially starts out as one thing and ends up another, constantly tightrope walking a razor-thin tonal line. Indeed, this balance between light and dark is probably its best aspect. The piece delivers moments of humour alongside moments of horror, each as genuine as the other. It's always entertaining, whether comedic or unsettling, and it's very well-made, to boot. Interestingly, the focal family aren't really all that empathetic once they start taking things a little too far, attempting to usurp the innocent and hard-working staff of the rich family they're 'scamming'. This isn't really detrimental, though. It's a distinct decision meant to keep us questioning who is really in the right, no matter whose perspective we're in. What it also does, however, is somewhat dampen the impact of the picture's proposed theme. Its comments on class perhaps don't quite come full circle - at least, not in the way you'd expect. Another issue is the fact that the initial protagonist sort of gets lost once his family moves further into the picture, but this isn't detrimental as the flick plays out in an ensemble fashion and the initial lead still gets a decent amount to do. Each member of the focal family has a decisive personality and their dynamic is believable. For me, the movie's second half - marked by its biggest tonal shift - isn't necessarily as successful as the first, despite it being the 'real beginning' according to director Bong Joon Ho. Of course, the film is always compelling. It's astutely crafted, too. Despite a few issues, it's an entertaining experience throughout. It's fantastic. 9/10.","Feb 11, 2020"

9,"As Stakes Rapidly Rise, a Clever Family of Con Artists Slips Underwater","A relatively simple, low-key racket spirals way out of control as an impoverished lower class Korean family smoothly weasels their way into the lives of a wealthy, naive, white collar household.

Unpredictably composed, Parasite effortlessly shifts between several genres, evenly mixing comedy with tragedy and several stops in between. Of the versatile tools in that particular box, the film's at its best on the frequent occasions that it ratchets up the tension. I constantly caught myself holding in a deep breath, completely immersed in the moment and conflicted about the best possible outcome. Not all of those nail-biters lead to fireworks, and the film is careful not to overplay its hand, so that, when the time is right, those inevitable explosions land like a flurry of unexpected body blows.

The first hour is captivating, as the leeches' shady plot comes together and their long con gains momentum, but the home stretch, with its string of sharp curves and grim consequences, is unrestrained chaos in the best of ways. One helluva ride.","Jan 29, 2020"

It replicates the cold and honest reality of the outside world of poor and rich differences.

How do rich people live ?

Do we have a choice ?

9,The Privilege Class crashes into the Working poor,"My Review- Parasite My Rating 9/10

I'm so glad I got to finally see Parasite today on the day it won 2 well deserved BAFTA British Academy Awards Best Movie not in The English Language and Best Original Screenplay for its writer/ director Bong Joon Ho.

Parasite has already received numerous accolades, with six nominations at the 92nd Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Director and Best International Feature Film, making it the first South Korean film to receive Academy Award recognition. At the 77th Golden Globe Awards, the film won the award for Best Foreign Language Film. It received four nominations at the 73rd British Academy Film Awards. It also became the first non-English film to win the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture.

The film's title ""Parasite"" was selected by Bong as it served a double meaning, which he had to convince the film's marketing group to use. Bong said ""Because the story is about the poor family infiltrating and creeping into the rich house, it seems very obvious that Parasite refers to the poor family, and I think that's why the marketing team was a little hesitant. But if you look at it the other way, you can say that rich family, they're also parasites in terms of labor. They can't even wash dishes, they can't drive themselves, so they leech off the poor family's labor. So both are parasites.""

I read Director and script writer Bong Joon is a great admirer of Alfred Hitchcock and I'm sure Hitch would praise this movie even the music score is reminiscent of Hitchcock films . The film makes several nods to Alfred Hitchcock throughout. Stairs are used as a motif, voyeurism is used as characters watch scenes through windows 14 times, and (most obviously) there is a brief glimpse of an out of place Alfred Hitchcock collection in the Park's home. I thought it also reminded me of Quentin Tarantino in its dark comedy and there are some very funny moments especially in the first half of this unique and original film.

Unfortunately I've only seen Parasite on DVD but I hope to see it again on a Cinema Screen soon. It's a movie I want to watch again as it's as good as all the hype it's getting and what a journey! it takes the audience on. Described as a Black Comedy Thriller as of 2/2/20 this film had grossed a Worldwide $163.3 million and was estimated to have cost $11 million to produce.

Of course I don't know any of the actors but they're all terrific in their roles and as an ensemble cast one of the best this year . I still think it's odd to include this film in 2 Best Film Categories at next weeks Academy Awards it had no chance of winning Best Picture but I'm certain it will win Best International Feature Film and it probably deserves to. I'm still so fond of Pedro Almodóvar's Pain & Glory..

Ps an add on comment after seeing Parasite on a Cinema screen the best way to appreciate a film like this.

After seeing Parasite on a Cinema Screen at last I appreciate the movie even more. There's so much to absorb and think about in the layers of Pasasite. The story depicts Class divides, Climate Catastrophes, Nuclear War fear and Violence due to mental illness and resentment. I was wrong in my first review to think Parasite had no chance of Winning Best Film of the year and I still think it's unfair that films in a Foreign Language have 2 bites of the Best Film cherry but this movie is a great film .

This is not a new review my original will do but just an observation after seeing ""Emma"" this week which portrayed Upper Class 19th Century snobbery and class division then the excellent HBO series ""Succession ""portraying an incredibly wealthy Media magnates family living a life of incredible privilege financed by greed and cunning plotting the next coup. The common thread that Parasite, Emma and Succession have is total separation from the feelings and aspirations of anyone outside their Class it's survival at all costs and disregard anyone who smells differently speaks differently, dresses differently or anyone doesn't process a degree or wealth. The poor family's ingenious scheme to obtain a better life regardless of the outcome shows more intelligence and hope to improve their situation than the insular, neurotic self obsessed rich Park family.

2 comments from Parasite said by Ki-taek and wife Chung-sook stay in my mind .

Ki-taek: They are rich but still nice. Chung-sook, Ki-taek's wife: They are nice because they are rich.

Chung-sook, Ki-taek's wife: If I had all this I would be kinder.

Ki-taek: Rich people are naive. No resentments. No creases on them. Chung-sook, Ki-taek's wife: It all gets ironed out. Money is an iron. Those creases all get smoothed out by money.

Both families end up with creases and resentments in Parasite so I guess both families fit the definition of Parasites-

9,An Ongoing Metaphor About Class Struggle,"GRADE: B+

THIS FILM IS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.

IN BRIEF: Brilliantly directed, Parasite is a dark satire about class warfare that burrows into your moviegoing pleasure and doesn't let go.

JIM'S REVIEW: Korean director Bong Joon-ho is a very versatile talent whose work is always visionary and highly personal, but not always successful due to his penchant for overstatement. His film subjects most always deal with social issues and oppressive forces against the common man. Yet, his films can range to a host of genres, from horror film to surreal sci-fi to political satire. One cannot easily pigeonhole this director and even his lesser films which become borderline contrived, still contain powerful messages about greed, consumerism, and class struggles.

Parasite may be his best film to date. It is a thrilling and complicated tale that keeps the moviegoer guessing its outcome. The film starts out as a dark comedy, then suddenly veers into pure satire before finishing its journey as a crime story. It is an exhilarating ride. Dare I say, very twisted, metaphorically speaking.

The literate screenplay by Han Jin-won and co-authored by the director contrasts two Korean families: the Kims, a clan of poor grifters living in squalor in a sub-basement apartment doing menial low-paying jobs just to get by, and the Parks, an affluent and dysfunctional family that take their wealth unwisely for granted. The Kims' work their way into the Parks' lives through their lies and deceptive action, all resulting in tragic events.

The script cleverly weaves The Kims' greedy scheming against the Parks' naivety and shallowness to a crescendo of mayhem and violence. The film does have one too many anti-climatic endings and needed a bit more concise storytelling for stronger impact, but Bong Joon-ho masterfully conveys his raging vision of the working class and the elite at war.

The cast is wonderful. Song Kang-ho is the impoverished patriarch and Jang Hye-jin is his shrewish wife. Choi Woo-shik is their idealistic son and Park So-dam is their wily daughter. They battle Lee Sun-kyan as a haughty businessman and Cho Yeo-jeong, in a scene-stealing role, as his fragile and dim wife.

Strong production values reinforce the sharp divide between the classes. Visually, the dirty and cramped cluttered apartment contrasts dramatically with the sunlit contemporary Architectural Digest prototypes created by designer Ha-jun Lee. Cinematographer Kyung-pyo Hong lenses the two settings, lighting one home in dark umber hues and claustrophobic low angles while using bright intense lighting to imply the stark formal symmetry of the other dwelling in order to establish the imbalance of both families.

Parasite is insightful and excels in its execution. Bong Joon-ho creates lasting images that correspond directly to his narratives. His film has much to say about the ongoing power struggle between those who have and those who have not. Simply put, it is one of the year's best films.","Nov 8, 2019"
9,Well....I didn't expect 'that' after the first half. That's for sure!,"(Flash Review)

WOW! I did not see all that coming. The film sets the stage with this severely lower class family who live in a crappy garden apartment who hatch a plan to fake their way into a wealthy family's life to feed off them like parasites. They are doing real services but under a false guise while earning the family's trust. With ample tension and drama there, the film then shifts up a gear with a surprise revelation about the previous housekeeper. Topping that, the film shifts into high gear with a wild grand finale. The story was original, well-written and semi-believable with twists that don't cheat the viewer. Complimented by great cinematography and editing made the film gripping and captivating. This film can be analyzed from several angles and is aptly named so watch, enjoy, ponder.","Feb 5, 2020"
9,Time Flew By,"This is a great film, it made me laugh, it made me think, it surprised me continuously. All the actors are consistently real and interesting. The story line progresses nicely and then hits with a number of surprises that I did not expect. I thoroughly enjoyed this film and do not want to say more that might give away any of the interesting twists that occur. It has been well reviewed by many and should do well in the theaters.","Oct 27, 2019"

9,Best dinner ends with a worst sweet dish!,"Very much enjoyable, loveable and heart warming piece of art. But the end didn't match with the flavour of the movie and came to me as if a beautiful road trip has ended with a crash but still its a must watch.","Apr 29, 2020"
9,Terrific Satire on Social Classes,"I am not typically one for being big on foreign films, however given the notoriety of it winning big picture and all it could not be ignored. And for good reason, this was simply just great movie making! It has so many elements such as comedy, drama, and hold your breath suspense. And a very original story.

While watching, my wife stated this almost seems like a much better version of Jordan Peele's 'Us', which I would agree with. I feel like both movies try to deliver the same message, though Parasite is far superior in doing so.

This was satire at its finest as the film looks at two very different families, one being rich, and the other being poor. These two social classes will clash, but just as you think to have it all figured out, a huge wrench is thrown into the plot and it goes from crazy to ludicrous. The tension is huge throughout because you don't even know who you're cheering for. There's no defined bad guys or good guys, all have their qualities you commend, but also flaws. Every character is beautifully acted as well.

Not at any time was I bored. The characters and story lock your attention up, while you wait in anticipation on how this whole wild ""situation"" will turn out.","Sep 21, 2020"
9,"If this wasn't named ""Parasite"" I'd be running to the theater to watch this.","The problem is that the Koreans and Japanese and other people from that side of the world make so many disturbing movies that I just don't watch them. Now the name of this movie is ""Parasite"" and that doesn't fill me with confidence. But I've been assured that this is not a disturbing movie so I'll go give it a chance. But the one thing I have to say, only in America can a foreign language film win best picture in the greatest award ceremony of the year.","Feb 10, 2020"
9,Morally grey,"Despite the fact that at first glance the film seems quite simple, drawing the viewer's interest and slowly moving to mostly comedic elements, after the first hour the situation changes fundamentally.

We get to know better both of the families and it becomes clear that there are no characters to root for, no ""good guys"" of the story. The film focuses on ""crossing the line"" which has multiple meanings and is manifested in different ways during the viewing.

I don't want to spoil anything, so I definitely recommend watching this closely and then re-visiting this film after some time since it has a lot of brain fuel to keep you busy thinking about it.","Jan 5, 2020"
9,Don't think you know what's coming up next,"I was told before that this movie will surprise me with things i may expect. So even with this information i was totally stunned in some scenes. It's going more and more wired but you can't stop watching.

First it's all about the poor and the rich. You can feel this huge gap between the families but this movie is so much more than that. Don't think to much, enjoy the ride and pls don't watch it with your kids!

We were fascinated from the first few minutes and never was there a dull moment. Great acting, great story and a very very well directed movie!

9,What a good movie looks like,"This movie is clever on so many levels, the acting is impeccable, the story-line unexpected and the directing flawless but I don't want to give too much away, just watch it. In this era of super heroes and sequels, this is a breath of fresh air and a sign that there's still hope for the craft.","Jan 18, 2020"
9,"You laugh, and then... you can't, anymore","A film that is generally given positive reviews is SE7EN, the fateful tale of Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman chasing Kevin Spacey through a labyrinth of human depravity, leading to a conclusion that is still referenced to this day. Regardless of how well the film was made, how good the acting was, and how the twist worked to serve the story...

I HATED SE7EN. And while I don't necessarily hate PARASITE, I'm quite certain I'm not going to be rushing to see it again, nor will I be adding it to any library of movies I might have.

It starts out with a family of have-nothings getting inter wrapped with a family of have-everythings, at first in the vein of comedy. There's a dark thread that runs through each step the Kim family takes as they get more and more involved with the Park family, their house, and their valuables, but for the majority of the first two acts of the film, the general levity is well kept. You play along, wanting to see what will happen next.

But then, there's a twist, one that ends the comedy in a single strike. The Kim family, whom we don't necessarily support in their actions but try to find reasons to accept why they choose to do to the Park family what they do, suddenly raise the bar on their pursuits, at the cost of any level of ethics. The humor is, at a single point in the movie, lost forever, leaving us only with the same vein of horror that one might have found watching SE7EN, which is why I brought that film up in the first place. Where you might have started the film smiling, you spend the end of the movie battling a kind of nausea, as the characters change from semi-decent misunderstood people (on both sides of the spectrum) into NOT so decent people (on both sides of the spectrum).

I have to give chops where chops are due. Bong Joon Ho masterfully directs this film, from the choice of lighting and shots to the actors chosen for their performances and the extreme conditions that they are put through to really make the point of this film stand out. And in truth, the point that is trying to be made here IS the reason to watch this movie, and in that regard it is a success. Once you've seen PARASITE, it may be a long time before you forget about it, and maybe it will give you some interesting food for thought, as it did me. You've never looked at the world through a lens like this, I promise you.

So, just like SE7EN, nobody pulls their punches here. Everyone delivers a damn good performance. The flow is perfect (even if the mood shifts), and everyone here does their best to make this film work.

And overall, it certainly does. It's impressive, in so many ways.

But if you're looking for any kind of lighthearted fare, I'm afraid you'll have to look elsewhere. This one's not for the faint of heart.","Sep 21, 2020"
9,Cinematic marvel,"Four highly coveted Oscars (including Best Picture, Best Director, Best Original Screenplay), being awarded to a foreign-language film, is an unprecedented event in my memory. This makes Parasite (South Korean 2019 tragicomedy) a must-see movie. Having just come out of the theatre, I can admit in all sincerity that the film has affected me on multiple levels. But before broaching the poignant essentials, should firstly dispense with the banal, which I expect the woke and self-righteous movie-goers are likely to focus on. These will undoubtedly include such predictable clichés as injustices of income inequality, disdain of the chauffeur-driven elite towards ""smelly"" subway riders, aloof callousness to the upper classes, etc. These elements are undeniably featured in the film, but purely as a foil for a deeper exploration of the human psyche, which deserves to be examined with some specificity. Viewer warning: Parasite, while a monumental piece of cinematic work, is not a joyous viewing experience. The unrelenting intensity, unleashed on the viewer almost from the start (not too dissimilar to that of observing a circus acrobat on a tight rope without the safety net), is sustained without respite throughout the two-hour-plus duration. Armed with only a cursory knowledge of the South Korean society, culture, and class hierarchy, I felt somewhat disadvantaged, particularly during the early scenes. At the risk of being exceedingly presumptuous, I fear that most of the US movie-going public might be in the same boat, despite the prominence of the ubiquitous Samsung, KIA Motors and other Korean brands permeating global markets. If not for the omnipresent media denunciations of its dangerously unpredictable neighbor to the north, we would probably know even less about the Region. While ignorance is generally considered to be a bliss, in the case of Parasite, not knowing the Korean societal dynamics, one can't help but experience the frustrations of cognitive dissonance right from the start. On the one hand, we are presented with:
While on the other hand:
The initial culturally ""foreign"" element driving the dissonance is that despite the unambiguously self-reliant and skilled family members, the mother feels she needs to kick the husband out of his slumber to ""come up with the plan"". An accomplished hammer-thrower evidently needs a man to do the heavy lifting (pun intended) when it comes to figuring out options for protecting the family or improving its finances. What makes these incompatible realities even more disjointed is the apparent inability of the siblings, who clearly exhibit an above-average portfolio of skills, to claim their proper station in society. The brother, while devoid of formal university education, has superior math, English and college entrance test-acing skills. The sister, in addition to her mastery of drawing and appealing looks, has perfected the improv and BS artistry to such an extent that in any meritocratic setting she would easily achieve a distinguished career in marketing, politics or screenplay writing. The film creators are seemingly posing a two-part question: 1. is it the social status and family pedigree, rather than merit, that acts as a dominant determinant of one's ability to succeed; or perhaps... 2. it is a self-inflicted limitation imposed by one's own belief system that places the current circumstance or family history to be the obstacle to advancement? The filmmakers are hinting at the latter by incorporating the heavy rock imagery, introduced to the audience in a form of a gift by a family friend (looks more like a ginormous paperweight, rather than heirloom). The brother becomes so inextricably linked to the rock, particularly during periods of high stress, that he seems unable to separate himself from it no matter where he goes. Predictably (in keeping with Chekhov's dramatic principle) this heavy rock becomes the instrument of his near demise. Curiously, it is the same metaphorically tuned brother who misses such an obvious boulder of a symbol (again pun intended). However, it is the juxtaposition of the affluent Parks vs the poor Kims in the film that takes the cake (definitely, pun intended). An unspoken shield seems to reliably insulate the wealthy from various external forces. While a heavy downpour can dispossess the slum dwellers of their property entirely, it is only a minor inconvenience for the wealthy (down to the leak-proof pretend American Indian tents). While basements of the rich can withstand a nuclear attack from the pot-bellied dictator north of the border, any substantial deluge simply drowns basements (or basement homes, as the case might be) of the poor in raw sewage. Another purpose of incorporating the heavy rain scene into the film is to remind us that often ""when it rains, it pours"". That is, while the Kims managed to cleverly contrive themselves into the Parks' household, the elation proved to be short-lived as they discovered other subterranean dwellers in the Parks' house, whose status is even lower than that of the Kims, leading to dramatic disequilibrium to a comfortable and promising situation. According to the filmmakers, while the invisible walls of wealth and privilege protect the affluent class from external threats, no one is safe when it comes to the ""enemy within."" The message here seems to be that as long as the class resentment is obvious and inter-class mobility is driven by factors other than merit (e.g., antecedent, lack of connections, body odor, cheap underwear or any other subjective and artificial boundaries) the risk of societal discontent is always lurking in the background, bringing the fragility of human existence to the forefront, often causing the innocent to suffer. The carnage scene in the latter part of the film, while abrupt and sudden, can indeed be foreshadowed as a natural consequence of open expression of disdain that Parks Sr. signals to Kim Sr. in no uncertain terms. Where I struggle with my interpretation of the film is the title. There are no obvious parasites in the plot. Even the subterranean male dweller performs light sensor duties at appropriate moments, thereby communicating his respect and appreciation. The Kims dutifully fulfill their respective roles. While the Parks Sr. works for his money. Perhaps the idea behind the title is to suggest that there is a symbiotic feeding off one another that remains fundamentally destructive as long as the gulf between societal layers remains unbridged. Not sure. Need to think about it some more. Nine out of ten.","Feb 15, 2020"

The story is captivating. There is nothing in this masterpiece that will leave you bored, dissatisfied, or wanting more. Bong Joon-ho has been on my radar for years, I've seen his best work and so far I have never been disappointed.

There are only a dozen or so perfect movies, and Parasite might be among them. It's a comedy, a drama, a thriller, a documentary in some way. It's amazing. It's my favorite movie of 2019, and that despite Once Upon A Time in Hollywood being one of the best QT and 2019 movies. Do yourself a favor and watch it! It's an easy and enjoyable experience.

9,Class Struggle and Deception The Visual Representation.,"Directed by Bong Joon-ho. ""Parasite"" follows the members of a poor household (Kim) scheming to become employees of a much wealthier family (Park) by posing as unrelated, highly qualified individuals.

This movie exceeded my expectations. What a way to showcase class struggles and differences between the wealthy and financially lacking in brilliantly done social commentary! This movie feels like it's moving at lightning pace because of how effortlessly it flows. There isn't a dull moment to it, you're either on edge or learning more about it's well-defined characters. Each is distinct and so well performed. I recognized Korean-Canadian actor Woo-sik Choi from ""Train to Busan"" (he's looking fine in this too btw XD) as the brother Ki-Woo. I may be biased because I've grown to really like seeing him, but he was my favorite character in this film. I see him as the main character since he really starts the film with a conversation and ends it with a monologue to his father. Really well done, applause to you sir!

I loved seeing the scheming involved in this, with a name like ""Parasite"" I thought this was going to be sci-fi in nature. But it's not at all! It's more of a home invasion film where the rich owners willingly allow these people to come into their lives. The Kim family were some sneaky ba****** let me tell you and I loved it! It's like a better version of Ocean's films (sorry fans of that series), but with less heisting and more actual manual labour. But still a lot of deception, showing class division without making the rich too ""villain-like"". So seeing as the story/screenplay was superb, it's of course coupled with great camerawork/visual representations and an on-point soundtrack to back it up. There's some amazing parallel driven scenes that involve flooding that show that you don't have to treat an audience like they need to be spoon-fed information. Which I appreciate a lot! I'm so glad this film had a U.S. release because not having people over here see it because of subtitles...that would be tragic! I want more foreign films released in theatres over here to be honest!

This by far is one of the best films of 2019. It's thrilling, funny, tragic and very very intelligent. Please watch it if you haven't! I'm definitely going to have to check out more from the director/co-writer because he's impressed me highly and clearly is a master at his own craft. I love Asian cinema and foreign films in general, this is exactly why. You miss out on so much greatness if you stick to only ""your language"" while watching films. Don't be one of those people! I'm going to have to watch the movie a few more times to really pick up on everything. Also final side-note, the poster for this film is genius. You'll know what I mean once you've watched it.","Jan 23, 2020"

9,A very funny film about corruption of the soul,"Being a Korean language film was not the only reason Bong Joon-ho's 'Parasite' was an unlikely multiple Oscar winner; it's also unusually dark. A vicious black comedy, it tells the story of an impoverished family who think they've found a meal-ticket for life when they manage to displace the servants of a gullable rich one; but it turns out they're not the only desparate people in town. Everyone can enjoy its ingenious plot and wonderful sense of aesthetic; but at heart, this is a serious film about how both wealth and poverty corrupt the soul. As such, it has no heroes; and its victims are either not innocent, or, if they are, have no right to be. There's no question it deserved it's awards.","Nov 29, 2021"

9,'Parasite' is generous in giving you the cerebral food,"Parasite is a deep, complex, layered, multidimensional and heartfelt portrayal of the class struggle and its gruesome ramifications existing in the present day South Korea. It is seen through a social prism where the haves are pitted against the haven'ts, the haven'ts are pitted against each other . It is also a subtle tale of the dangerous magnitude of the impacts of human greed and how nature backfires against a consumer culture. From the gift rock to the deluge towards the climax, Director Bong Joon Ho of 'Memories of Murder' and 'The Host' fame uses several metaphors to depict how nature backlashes against human's imperialistic pleasures . As a result, what starts in a mild satirical tone, climaxes in a disturbing manner, so much to the extent that even hours after finishing the movie, you can not actually get out of the eerie milieu of South Korean urban class struggle. This is no easy movie, let me remind you. But if you can finish the journey, it can stay with you forever, for the ample food for thought it offers. Truly a cinematic masterpiece from the ace Korean director. Predicting huge applause at the Academy Awards this year, may be the Holy Grail of movie making as well. A must watch for those who are cerebrally way ahead of the cheap DC Comics genre.","Feb 9, 2020"
9,Equal opportunity bashing.,"Bong Joon Ho (writer/director} is usually known for bashing the rich and powerful.. In this film he takes aim also at the poor who are depicted as conniving, immoral grifters. The Parks, the rich family who are the prey of the poor Kim family are shown as mostly naïve rather than cruel, The film is comedic for the first half and then takes a violent and serious turn. Riveting and thought provoke, highly recommended.","May 9, 2020"
9,masterpiece,"After leaving the movie it makes you think. Parasite made history by winning Oscars for best screenplay, best film and best director, independent of the actor. As the first foreign film, it broke new ground in this sense, in addition to winning the Best Film Oscar. Because there is no film in Oscar history whose actors have achieved a hat trick without receiving any awards. While the lower class becomes blind by ignoring their situation by not rebelling against the economic order; from the parasitic settlement and reality around the bourgeoisie; In this movie, he is blind because of the drunkenness brought by the extravagant life. What I told you is only a small part of it. That's exactly why this movie is so important.","Sep 20, 2023"
9,A real roller-coaster of a film,"This was intriguing from the start, but I was worried that the different cutural values might prevent my enjoyment. My concern disappeared as the film became more and more bizarre; I was completely caught up.","Dec 13, 2019"
9,Achieves what Jordan Peele set out to do with Us,"As a film about a family imposing on another, and keeping dark secrets hidden beneath the surface, Parasite achieves what Jordan Peele set out to do with Us: tell a multi-layered story in a widely entertaining manner, but without sacrificing the believability of its central narrative.

That's not to say that Us is an ineffective film by any means, but when it comes to crafting weighty social commentaries under the guise of lighter fare, writer-director Bong Joon-ho is in a class of his own.

The film follows a lower-class South Korean family as they slowly integrate themselves in the lives of an upper-class family and their lavish household. As their entanglement is spun out of a web of deceit, the lowly family find themselves skating on thin ice when it comes to keeping up appearances.

It's a twisty satire on social-economic disparities in South Korean society that swings broadly in tone, and sometimes threatens to tip over the edge, but never feels less than meticulously calculated in its tonal shifts.

However, to reveal anything more about the story would be to take away from the overall experience, as each act is marked by a major plot twist or revelation that keeps the film one step ahead of the viewer at all times. Go in blind if you can and expect an unforgettable ride.","Jul 2, 2019"

9,A Masterful Mosaic: The Social Genius of Gisaengchung,"Gisaengchung (Parasite) is a cinematic triumph that defies genre boundaries, blending dark humor, sharp social commentary, and riveting suspense into a seamless and unforgettable experience. Bong Joon-ho's direction is nothing short of genius, weaving a story that is both deeply personal and universally resonant.

The film's intricate narrative unfolds with precision, balancing its biting critique of class disparity with moments of profound humanity. Each character is richly developed, brought to life by an ensemble cast whose performances are nothing less than extraordinary.

What sets Gisaengchung apart is its ability to surprise and challenge, urging viewers to confront uncomfortable truths while keeping them thoroughly engaged. It's a film that thrives on contrasts-light and dark, humor and tragedy, hope and despair-all delivered with visual and emotional brilliance. Bold, thought-provoking, and utterly mesmerizing, Gisaengchung is a modern masterpiece that demands to be seen and felt.","Dec 5, 2024"
9,Curiosity,"I watched this movie three times. it was fantastic and masterpiece like everyone said. there are tons of videos about this movie/subtext on youtube. I was wondering, while the director was reviewing the comments, was it something similar he thought during the filmmaking process or are people going too deep. light/dark, high/low, smell, rich/poor all these contrast are just beautiful.","Feb 4, 2020"
9,Parasite (2019),"Directed by Bong Joon-ho. Starring Song Kang-ho, Choi Woo-shik, Chang Hyae-jin, Park So-dam, Cho Yeo-jeong, Lee Sun-kyun, Lee Jung-eun, Jeong Ji-so, Park Myung-hoon, Jung Hyeon-jun, Park Seo-joon, Park Geun-rok. (R)

Teen-aged Choi, from a lower-class, unemployed family, deceives his way into a position as tutor for the daughter within the prosperous Park family; soon, the rest of his family begins ingratiating (and insinuating) themselves into the Park's lives. To tell more would spoil the pleasures of this deliciously demented parable on class, greed, prejudice and more. As expected from a Bong Joon-ho film, the tone boldly changes at will (mostly between hysterical satire and nerve-wracking thriller), but the transitions are more fluid than ever before for the talented filmmaker--or perhaps it's just because the story and technique is so gripping. Meticulously designed and flawlessly performed by its cast (the first foreign-language group to ever score the ensemble cast award from the Screen Actors Guild), its audacious tangle of ideas and statements packaged with artful, precise elegance. Some of the metaphors come off as shopworn in their exactness, but the film is so otherwise ingeniously constructed that it takes effort to recall in the aftermath exactly how the incidents all piled up. Amusing scriptwriting workshop exercise idea: present the first twenty minutes and last twenty minutes of the movie and see how someone tries to navigate a connection between the endpoints.

9,powerful depiction of class struggle,"A haunting movie, Parasite depicts a poor working family who gets involved with a well-to-do family by working for them, and more.

Details of the working family's life make the film nuanced - where the daughter goes for a bit of freedom, how the son hopes to escape his poverty - especially when a classmate recommends him for a tutoring job. The family pools its energies to survive.

Then there are the attitudes of the wealthy family and their lifestyle. Their shiny house.

I walked out of the movie theater saying ""Wow"" repeatedly because I was so impressed. I'm now a complete fan of Bong Joon Ho.","Sep 27, 2024"
9,Geography Classes,"A lot has been made of the social commentary, the message, of ""Parasite,"" but I think the picture is effective because the message is not overly blunt and because the structure--largely geographical--supporting it is congruent. Plus, it's unpredictable genre-mixing entertainment otherwise. That's not to say the social commentary isn't obvious, though, and rather nihilistic. There's ambiguity and complications as to which characters are the ""parasites."" While one suspects that our sympathies are supposed to be with the lower-class Kim family, they are the ones conning the upper-class Parks. In one sequence, to deter detection, they even hide, crawl and slither about like the insects that infest their own home. But, then, the Parks often come across as a vacuous family of privilege who tend to hold their employees in contempt. In effect, they're all parasites--even the former workers that the Kims replace by tricking the Parks into firing them. Every major character tries to exploit or debase others in some way or another. The Kims get others fired, forge their own qualifications and take advantage of the Parks' trust. Conversely, the Park parents mock the smell of Kim Ki-taek, and they pretend to be slumming it for sex roleplay. Their daughter is more interested in her tutor as a boyfriend instead of as hired help, and even the young son misinterprets a cry for help in Morse code and is a fan for the cultural appropriation of Native Americans.

The only other Bong Joon-ho movie that I've seen thus far, ""Snowpiercer"" (2013) is more heavy-handed in its depiction of class. In it, the rich exploit the poor; it's as straightforward as the continuously-running train. ""Parasite"" is more steeply layered. The upstairs-downstairs class stratification is reflected in Seoul's geography. The Kims live in a semi-basement in a crowded urban area. We only ever see them arrive home by descending stairs, whereas they ascend them to work for the Parks in their luxurious suburban estate with a backyard. While it rains at the Park's home, that of the Kims is also flooded by sewage, including feces raining on them from the toilet. A drunk urinates outside their window and even tries to literally piss on them at one point. Others of poverty turn out to inhabit spaces even lower--in a hidden bomb shelter below another flight of stairs. This further references the larger line of demarcation separating North and South Korea, which itself mirrors Mr. Park's condemnation of ""crossing the line."" Even the hope of upward mobility is represented in the landscape--by a stone.

Besides reflecting the message, all of this geography also serves the narrative. What begins as a black comedy and con-artist film, with actors playing actors, turns into a mix of suspense thriller and old-dark-house horror beginning with one stormy night. Characteristic of the haunted-house subgenre, there's already the aforementioned secret bunker, and there's also a ghostly, mysterious assailant (and the figure of the youngest Park's supposed trauma reflected in his artwork). There's even fantasy in the Kims' son's dream of upward mobility and a grand guignol finale. It's also a well-composed picture, with an exciting score and amusing performances. And, to top off this multi-layered message movie, there's the Morse-code messaging. Messages inside a message... genres upon genres, actors within actors, characters within characters, haves among the have-nots--all underlined geographically.","Dec 11, 2019"
9,Unexpected and Thought-Provoking,"Beautifully shot, acted, and written, this film is a unique specimen. About halfway through, the tone shifts quite dramatically, but is done in a way that doesn't feel abrupt. The characters feel real, and the main family has such a powerful dynamic. When the tension amps up, its palpable and keeps viewers engaged.

While I am not an expert in Korean culture, I feel like this film does a great job of teaching through showing. The gaps in class are shown masterfully, and the poor family's views on the rich family make sense. I would definitely recommend this movie to all fans of foreign cinema, and film in general.","Sep 7, 2024"
9,"A quirky, yet surprisingly well-made romp that could only come from somewhere like Korea","Parasite is a South Korean black comedy directed by Bong Joon-ho (Snowpiercer, OKJA). Based on a screenplay by Han Jin-won and Bong Joon-ho, it is a quirky, yet surprisingly well-made romp that could only come from somewhere like Korea.

In Seoul, the unemployed Kim family, led by Ki-taek, his wife Choong-sook, son Ki-woo, and daughter Ki-jeong try to get by in their cramped basement apartment. One day, Ki-woo's friend suggests to him that he take over as a tutor for the daughter of the rich Park family while he travels abroad. Over time, the rest of the Kim family start taking jobs offered to them by the Parks at their large mansion while masquerading under fake names so as not to give away that the four of them are related and eventually start to reap the benefits of the Park's swanky lifestyle.

With its unique Korean style, Parasite has just the right balance between dark comedy and family drama that it never bores its audience. It's just so much fun seeing how each member of the Kim family were adjusting to their new lavish ways in a house that doesn't even belong to them. This feels like a commentary on societal class in Korea, in how each citizen likely has their own perspective on how to live in the moment. Even better is the ending, which I will not spoil, but what I will say is that it concludes the story in the best way possible. If you watch one Korean movie this year, make it this one.","Oct 3, 2019"
9,A masterpiece of social commentary and thrilling storytelling,"Bong Joon-ho's ""Parasite"" is a cinematic triumph that seamlessly weaves together elements of satire, suspense, and social commentary. Set in modern-day South Korea, the film follows the impoverished Kim family as they cunningly infiltrate the lives of the wealthy Park family. What begins as a tale of deception and manipulation soon spirals into a gripping exploration of class struggle and the disparity between the haves and have-nots.

The brilliance of ""Parasite"" lies in its ability to keep viewers on the edge of their seats while delivering thought-provoking commentary on societal inequality. Through its captivating characters and meticulously crafted plot twists, the film challenges viewers to confront uncomfortable truths about privilege, greed, and the human condition.

From its stunning cinematography to its stellar performances, ""Parasite"" captivates audiences from start to finish. It's a film that stays with you long after the credits roll, leaving you pondering its implications and eager to revisit its intricacies again and again.","May 11, 2024"
9,A Riveting and Genre-Defying Masterpiece,"The film centers around the Kim family, who live in poverty and struggle to make ends meet in a cramped basement apartment. Through a stroke of luck, the son, Ki-woo (Choi Woo-shik), secures a tutoring job for the wealthy Park family. As the Kims infiltrate the lives of the Parks, their symbiotic relationship takes unexpected turns, leading to a series of gripping and suspenseful events.

Bong Joon-ho's direction in ""Parasite"" is masterful, seamlessly blending elements of dark comedy, drama, and thriller to create a unique and immersive cinematic experience. The film's pacing is impeccable, with each scene meticulously crafted to build tension and keep the audience on the edge of their seats. Bong's ability to balance humor and suspense while delving into profound social themes is a testament to his storytelling prowess.

The performances in ""Parasite"" are exceptional across the board. The ensemble cast, including Song Kang-ho as the patriarch of the Kim family and Lee Sun-kyun as the affluent Mr. Park, deliver nuanced and captivating portrayals of their characters. Their chemistry and the dynamic interactions between the Kim and Park families add layers of complexity and depth to the narrative.

""Parasite"" is a film that defies easy categorization. It seamlessly transitions between genres, blending elements of satire, suspense, and social realism. Bong Joon-ho's screenplay is a meticulously crafted exploration of class dynamics, inequality, and the human desire for upward mobility. The film offers sharp social commentary, challenging the audience to examine the systems that perpetuate inequality and the lengths individuals will go to improve their circumstances.

Visually, ""Parasite"" is a feast for the eyes. The film's cinematography, production design, and meticulous attention to detail enhance its storytelling. The stark contrast between the cramped living conditions of the Kim family and the luxurious surroundings of the Park family serves as a visual metaphor for the stark disparities between social classes.

With its thought-provoking narrative and exceptional craftsmanship, ""Parasite"" has earned its place as a groundbreaking and universally acclaimed film.

In conclusion, ""Parasite"" is a riveting and genre-defying film that combines social commentary, suspense, and exceptional performances to create an unforgettable cinematic experience.

9,One worth watching,"It begins with a family of four from the lower class in Korean society: a father, mother, eldest son, and younger sister. Both parents are unemployed, and the children did not continue their education. They all lived in a basement room, but then suddenly it was like heaven had given a big blessing to this family. When the eldest brother's friend has to study abroad, So he entrusted him to teach English to a rich man's daughter. However, this apparent stroke of luck eventually leads to unforeseen disaster. And this is the first movie in 92 years of the Oscars to be the winner of this award. It is a non-English-language film.

It's undeniable this movie is famous and popularity because of the outstanding cinematography and unforgettable characters. First of all, I will talk about the best scenes that impressed and fascinated me while watching this movie. The scene of walking down the stairs to return to the Mouse Hole home while it rains occurs after the Parasitic family has to escape from the paradise they have only recently enjoyed. The Kim family ran home to save as much of their belongings as possible. After watching that scene made me feel like it reflects society that rich people are at a high point and can take the heart of a crisis, but poor people must overcome their own obstacles. Then, during the conversation with the lady during a phone call, she talked about something that made Kim Ki Taek stop. This is another scene that makes me feel that no matter what class or society you belong to, you will be criticized, looked down on, oppressed, and cynical by someone higher than you anyway.

While all the actors in the film deserve praise for their performances, Kim Ki Taek's character, portrayed by Song Kang Ho stands out of the narrative. I really love him because, he is the main characters that makes the story fun, hilarious, tense, and thrilling at the same time. He made the story colorful and not too stressful. I agree that some characters may detract from the main plot. Therefore, time doesn't seem fluid and it takes time to watch it several times to understand that point.

Transitioning to the architectural symbolism employed by the creator. The stark class divide is clearly expressed in the design of the Park family's home It has a raised entrance and clearly delineated glass edges. This suggests that the production is highlighting socio-economic differences. To reinforce the main issue of inequality.

Moving on to the movie's overall impact, I enjoyed with many emotions and perspectives, but the things that make this movie win so many awards and praise are the analysis and solving of each case and the clear satire of life. If anyone likes this kind of movie, it's certainly one worth watching.","Mar 9, 2024"
9,Real,"Bong Joon-ho's ""Parasite"" is a cinematic tour de force that defies genre conventions and delivers a thought-provoking commentary on class inequality. Set in South Korea, the film follows the Kim family as they infiltrate the lives of the wealthy Park family through a series of deceitful schemes. What begins as a darkly comedic tale of social climbing soon takes a sinister turn, as tensions between the two families escalate to a shocking climax.

Bong's direction is masterful, effortlessly blending elements of comedy, drama, and suspense to create a truly original and immersive experience. The film's meticulous pacing and intricate plotting keep audiences on the edge of their seats, while its sharp social commentary offers a biting critique of capitalism and the widening gap between the rich and poor.

The ensemble cast delivers exceptional performances, with each actor bringing depth and nuance to their respective roles. From the cunning Kim family to the oblivious Park family, every character is fleshed out and multi-dimensional, allowing viewers to empathize with their struggles and motivations.

Visually stunning cinematography and meticulous production design further elevate the film, immersing viewers in the contrasting worlds of the rich and poor. From the cramped and cluttered confines of the Kim's semi-basement apartment to the sleek and spacious modernity of the Park's mansion, every detail is meticulously crafted to enhance the film's themes and atmosphere.

""Parasite"" is a bold and daring work of cinema that leaves a lasting impact on its audience. It's a film that challenges viewers to confront uncomfortable truths about society and the human condition, while also providing moments of humor and humanity amidst the darkness.

9,[9.3] This movie rocks ;),"Man this movie was really good, maybe not mind blowing nor does it have alot of spectacle, but it tells it's story with so much care, thrill and precision that it doesn't need big spectacle.

In a lot of ways this movie reminded me of Better Call Saul's early seasons, with the elaborate schemes that unravel while the viewer watches. The start of the movie has a very positive tone along with it.

Speaking of tone that's probably what the movie does best, taking the light hearted cheerful tone and slowly over the course of the two hours slowly getting darker until the ending. Although the last minutes of runtime after the big ending scene I didn't care for too much myself, felt like it brought it back up from the grim ending back to the starts tone a tad too quickly to me.","May 25, 2024"
9,A Korean gem!,"A very pleasant surprise of how to combine something mysterious, and something with great horror elements but keeping it light with perfect black humor and not to give away too much at any point. The movie has this soft tension build up all throughout story progression and never really settles down on one tone.

Shortly after the start you kind of get the idea where things go, but you have no clue what is going to happen after that and how the protagonists are going to deal with the difficulties they are facing. The script was very cleverly written, makes you face a decision who you are rooting for. I could sympathize with either the ""good guys"" or the ""bad guys"" at any given point during the movie.

This movie should be a great example to Hollywood how to write and direct an original title, this is a Korean gem that will go down as one of the best in its genre and category.","Jan 5, 2020"
9,"Despite its lengthy 2 hour run, film keeps relentless pace that keeps viewers engrossed","Parasite is a remarkable masterpiece that captured the hearts of millions world-wide and rightfully earned its Oscar-winning status for Best Picture. Directed by Bong-Joon-ho, it portrays a grippingly raw story of class-struggle with incredible cinematography and exceptional acting.

The movie is immaculately shot, and the director brilliantly uses various elements of filmmaking to create an unsettling atmosphere of tension, humor, and horror. The ensemble of actors delivered top-notch performances, seamlessly coming together to tell a thrilling and captivating story.

Parasite is an unforgettable and remarkable cinematic experience that challenges traditional narratives and leaves a powerful impact. It's a must-see masterpiece that sets a high bar for cinema, and that too without feeling like a long-drawn-out affair.","Apr 26, 2023"
9,Intruders,"That's not really a home invading home topic, or in a very special way. I reminded another movie from 2013 and Netherlands called BORGMAN, very close about the topic and even more weird; try it if you can. I prefered BORGMAN, but that one if far better brilliant, bloody, ironic, cynical.","Jun 13, 2019"
9,Phenomenal!,"'Parasite' (2019) is one of the most unique explorations of class I have ever seen. The South Korean setting really emphasizes the themes also, especially from a westerner's perspective like mine!

Complementing these ideas portrayed, the editing and cinematography reinforces the extreme financial differences between the two families. The main house setting becomes almost like its own character within the film. It is modern but also has an undercurrent of isolation, which supports a reveal later in the narrative.

All of the performances were phenomenal. As the tensions begin to rise, we can see the clear desperation of the main family. I do not think I could predict anything that was going to happen in the narrative past a certain point. Additionally, the ending of the film is one of the best I have seen in quite a while.

Overall, I would highly recommend this Best Picture Winner! The tension builds throughout to an amazing finale, which is definitely worth seeing for yourself.","Dec 26, 2023"
9,Wealth corrupts,"Parasite, dark and satirical, reflects society's corruption in class struggle. The films follow a struggling family, the Kims, and their climb to fortune through working for a wealthy family, the Parks. Bong Joon-ho et al.'s fastidious composition of every frame, consistent symbolism, and contrasting color grading leave no doubt as to how Parasite garnered the 2020 Academy Awards for Best Picture, and several other nominations and wins. The film's ending, fresh and unexpected, never felt out of place as the subtleties of carefully placed details throughout the film foreshadow the ending's twist. The gifted stone, speculated to bring wealth, only brought corruption and misfortune; The bright red sauce splashed onto pizza foreshadowed the fatal consequences of the schemes crafted; The line that must never be crossed- except when one character does, all subconsciously produced the perfect atmosphere of the foreboding implication of something terrible to come.

The contrast of the darkness of the Kim's downstairs world to the Park's airy, bright, and naturally lit atmosphere forces the audience to reflect on their interpretation of class. As we watch the endings of each character, we have to wonder if they got what they deserved. How we feel about them forces us to confront our values- to many, this led to the feeling of discomfort and that the film was too 'odd'. The constant artificial lighting and dark grading of the downstairs world remind us of the Kim's goals to worm their way up in search of light. As Joon-ho's morally gray characters climb up the stairs or driveway, they reflect the inherent societal desires for wealth and the strive to achieve it. Joon-ho uses separate upstairs and downstairs worlds to supplement the film's message rather than to become the premise of it. This allows a fresher and freer interpretation of class struggle rather than recycling through past examples of this familiar piece of symbolism for class struggle. The character's journey of climbing up becomes another one of the film's several subtleties.","Nov 23, 2023"
9,Parasite new century,"Parasite is a cinematic marvel that goes beyond mere storytelling to deliver a deeply resonating commentary on the class disparities that pervade modern society. Directed by the brilliantly inventive Bong Joon Ho, the film effectively intertwines elements of drama, comedy, and thriller to create an experience that lingers long after the screen goes dark.

The narrative centers on two contrasting families and, through them, explores the complex dynamics of wealth, poverty, and human tendency. It's a masterly crafted web of intrigue that keeps the viewer engrossed and constantly on edge. The screenplay is astoundingly unpredictable and the sharp, crisp dialogue effectively builds tension while maintaining its dark humor.

The cast delivers stellar performances that bring their layered characters to life. Each actor stands out, portraying their varied characters with precision, be it the cunning yet charismatic poor family or the oblivious yet complicated wealthy family. The somber, atmospheric cinematography coupled with the haunting score creates an increasingly uneasy ambiance that height.","Nov 15, 2023"
9,Symbiotic as well as parasitic,"Parasite

The 2019 Academy Award winner for Best picture, Gisaengchung (translated as Parasite), tells the story of a poor Korean family that gets a break when the teenage son gets a job as a tutor for the daughter of a wealthy family. The portrayal of a caste system is jarring and near horrifying as the citizens of South Korea slide into their roles as they've been trained to all their lives. Until the Kim family begins to literally feed off the rich Park family, that is.

It starts out pretty harmless as a scheme to get the Kim family into household jobs is put in place. It takes a little bit to get this accomplished but it looks like things are improving for the impoverished family. However, no one expected one of the displaced former servants to return while the Park family is out for their son's birthday weekend. This. Gets. Dark. Fast.

It's interesting to see how the Korean culture has their system so ingrained that the rich won't even consider hiring the poor unless their business cards are pristine, or the owner of the agency vouches for their experience catering to the wealthy. It's sickening how nonchalantly the Park patriarch acts around this. But our parasitic family seizes on character flaws so quickly, nobody seems to catch on.

The film morphs into a suspense thriller so fast your heads will spin. I did not see that ending coming, at all. The parasitic infestation metaphor is so on the nose that there is even an insect extermination near the beginning.

The film could also have been titled symbiotic as the rich feed off the poor just as much, though more comfortably. The balance between the two needs to be maintained or, well, you'll see. It's been a long time since I've seen a psychological thriller mixed with social commentary get so many accolades but they are well deserved.","Feb 12, 2024"
9,nothing can kill them,"On one side is the flooded cottage, and on the other side is the birthday party. On one side is the cold and hard gym, and on the other is the luxurious and soft backyard. Money is an iron that irons everything flat. They scrape the internet, live in the basement, and do anything for a job. When you think they are already miserable enough, the movie suddenly turns around: they are not the worst yet, there are even worse ones. If you are rich, there must be someone richer than you; If you are poor, there must be someone even poorer than you. The wealth gap is like countless walls, dividing people into different classes. This wall stands tall even in the wind, sun, and rain, without moving a trace. The Park couple may seem foolish, but they are still getting richer and richer; The Jin Jize family is incredibly intelligent, but they still can't turn around. You think finding a good job with a good salary can lift you out of poverty, but in fact, it's still a thousand miles away. You can wash away the sweat smell from your clothes, but you cannot wash away the smell of the basement that has already merged into your blood. You have climbed ten or twenty floors, and may have just arrived at someone else's basement. They are insects, so their lives are difficult; They are insects, so nothing can kill them.","Oct 5, 2023"
9,"Really good, but not as good as others think","I really enjoyed this film, however it certainly isn't enough for a ten, nor do I think it's as good as people like to say it is. Nothing to do with the second half or anything really, I just believe it was a very good film, awesome idea, cool characters and pretty much great execution, it's just not the immense best film ever as I've seen some people refer it like, almost a ten, but not quite. I think Korean films such as these are one of the best in the industry of film, and if that doesn't make you want to watch it then I don't know what will. Definitely watch this film it has some shocking bits in and was very entertaining.","Nov 3, 2023"
9,Great cinematography. Very up-to-date message,"""Parasite"" rocks an incredibly well-crafted screenplay that smoothly mixes dark comedy, thriller vibes, and social drama. It's like a rollercoaster of plot twists that keeps you glued from start to finish.

This movie's all about class differences, digging deep into the gap between the rich and the poor. Bong Joon-ho's storytelling is pure genius, showing a sharp yet compassionate take on this social divide that'll make you think.

The cinematography by Hong Kyung-pyo is just drop-dead gorgeous. The movie pays serious attention to every little detail, whether it's the swanky Park mansion or the grimy Kim home. The contrast between these places really drives home the film's message.","Sep 3, 2023"
9,Poor people are the ghosts of high society.,"This movie is simply a rare gem.

An ambitious discourse separating social classes, wrapped in action, drama, depth and softened by comedy. The way the characters contrast with each other, despite their similarities, is admirable.

There's nothing to fault in this film.

Just surprising.

I'd like to congratulate the director on his ingenious editing and staging of the film, as the portrayal of the bourgeois and the poorer can literally tell the story. It's easy to understand the plot and the weight of what's at stake.

It's all fluidly brought to life, so you can enjoy it to the full.

It's clear that many subliminal messages are conveyed through simple objects or metaphorically placed boundaries.

A masterpiece.","Jul 24, 2023"
9,A Masterpiece of Storytelling and Social Commentary,"The criticism on social and economic inequalities in ""Parasite"" is one of the film's most outstanding features. The movie offers an incisive indictment of the class difference in contemporary society, demonstrating how the underprivileged frequently must rely on lies and trickery to get by in a system that is biased against them. The themes of the movie are subtly weaved into the action, resulting in a thought-provoking and emotionally stirring viewing experience.

I would unquestionably give this film 4.5 stars out of 5. My understanding of ""Parasite"" is consistent with the majority of the positive reviews the movie has gotten, including its several Academy Award nominations and Cannes Film Festival Palme d'Or award. However, I felt that some reviews overemphasized the social commentary of the film while ignoring its technical and artistic accomplishments. For instance, The Guardian's favorable review hails the movie's ""biting satire"" but just briefly highlights its superb photography and sound editing. Even though I acknowledge the value of the social critique, I think ""Parasite"" should be viewed as a whole cinematic endeavor.

The movie also has remarkable technical qualities. The script strikes the ideal balance between drama and humor, and the prose is snappy and funny. Each performer gives a nuanced and believable role, and the acting is excellent.","May 2, 2023"
9,Just something you wouldn't think at first place...,This movie is so relatable if you belong to a middle class family with unexpected ending. I felt connected and engaged with alot of characters in the movie. There are alot of scenes which were so true about high class society people. I love watching foreign language movies having a lit of different topics and real life struggles. This was actually an original dark comedy about class struggles. Please do try to watch award winning shows and movies which contain sensitive topics and real life struggles...Here I am trying to convince you guys to watch PARASITE and thank me later. You will love this film.,"Jul 20, 2023"
9,Thrilled,"""Parasite"" (2019) is a brilliant masterpiece that explores the theme of social class and inequality through the story of a poor family, the Kims, who infiltrate the lives of a wealthy family, the Parks, through deceit and cunning. The film is a masterclass in storytelling, cinematography, and acting, and it rightfully won the Palme d'Or at the 2019 Cannes Film Festival and the Best Picture at the 2020 Academy Awards.

Director Bong Joon-ho expertly weaves a complex narrative that is both suspenseful and emotionally gripping. The film starts with the Kims living in a dingy basement, struggling to make ends meet. However, their luck changes when the son, Ki-woo, lands a job as an English tutor for the Parks' daughter. From there, the Kims plot their way into the Parks' lives, taking on various roles as tutor, driver, and housekeeper. But as they grow more entrenched, they begin to uncover the dark secrets hidden within the Parks' mansion.

The cinematography by Hong Kyung-pyo is stunning, with each shot masterfully framed to highlight the stark contrast between the Kims' cramped living quarters and the Parks' spacious mansion. The use of light and shadow creates a sense of unease and tension that builds throughout the film.

The performances by the cast are outstanding, with each actor bringing depth and nuance to their characters. Song Kang-ho, who plays the father of the Kim family, is particularly outstanding, with his naturalistic acting style and subtle expressions conveying a range of emotions.

Overall, ""Parasite"" is a thought-provoking and engaging film that offers a scathing critique of the class divide in modern society. With its expert storytelling, stunning cinematography, and outstanding performances, it is a must-see film that will leave a lasting impact on viewers long after the credits have rolled.","Apr 12, 2023"
9,Not perfect but well worth the accolades,"Superbly acted, brilliantly written and gorgeous to look at. Not faultless and a couple of cracks/gripes in the last act but overall a beautifully constructed film. Nice to be kept thinking long afterwards and looking forward to seeing again.","Feb 19, 2020"
9,Surpassed expectations,"When my boyfriend suggested watching 'Parasite' I was reluctant, but I'm incredibly glad I said yes. It's a captivating movie that offers a wide range of genres.

Throughout the movie, Parasite illustrates how wealth inequality is the result of factors largely outside one's control, that class differences aren't totally earned, and social mobility is a bygone dream for many. The movie have the potential to resonate with audiences from all cultural backgrounds.. Director Bong Joon-ho's meticulous storytelling and brilliant cinematography create a gripping narrative that explores the complex dynamics of class struggle with both wit and depth. The film's seamless blend of dark comedy, suspense, and social commentary kept me on the edge of our sofa until the end.

I found the storyline to be thought-provoking.

The cast performs well, and it really sparked an interesting conversation.

'Parasite' is a must-watch that leaves a lasting impact.","Apr 21, 2024"
9,A disturbing yet beautifully woven tale of social disparity,"Bong Joon Wo's 'Parasite' is a disturbing yet beautifully woven tale depicting the dehumanizing gap between the haves and have-nots. Metaphorically and figuratively, Ki Tae's family live below the ground of the haves. Their toilet is even higher than their dwelling ground. This is how poor they are. They struggle to barely crawl up to the surface of economic adequacy, resorting to scams and deceptions, scrapping to make ends meet. The seeming victims are the Parks, a well to do family enveloped in the world of luxury and complacency. Much of the depictions of Ki Tae's family members would initially make the audience think of how despicable they are. While the parks are portrayed to be adequately tolerant of the underprivileged as long as their life is not in any way imposed. Slowly but surely the movie unravels. The subtext of hopelessness of classism soon reveals itself, mixed in with a very well thought out plot twists. 'Parasites' shows a world where the underprivileged are too wrapped in their own survival to recognize the trap they are in while the privileged are too busy meandering the labyrinth of western luxury. One of the best movies ever crafted for sure.","Nov 19, 2019"
9,Great movie and great director!!,"Recommendation for this great movie. Bitter comedy, which reflects today's society, through the prism of Korea.","Jan 19, 2020"
9,A masterpiece of a film,"""Parasite"" is a masterpiece of a film that expertly blends social commentary, suspense, and dark humor. The movie follows the poor and cunning Kim family, who scheme their way into the lives of the wealthy Park family, only to discover that their new hosts have secrets of their own.

Director Bong Joon-ho's filmmaking skills are on full display in ""Parasite,"" with expertly crafted shots and a precise attention to detail that elevates the film to a whole new level. The cast delivers outstanding performances, with Song Kang-ho's portrayal of Kim Ki-taek standing out as a particular highlight.

The film's themes of social class and inequality are presented in a unique and thought-provoking way, challenging viewers to question their own biases and privilege. ""Parasite"" is a darkly comedic and thrilling masterpiece that is not to be missed.","Mar 22, 2023"
9,A worthy winner!,"""Parasite"" is a stunning masterpiece of filmmaking. Directed by Bong Joon-ho, the film is a social commentary on class and wealth that is both deeply affecting and incredibly engaging.

At the heart of ""Parasite"" are the Kim family, a lower-class family struggling to make ends meet. When the opportunity arises for them to infiltrate the wealthy Park family, they jump at the chance, using their wits and cunning to gain entry into the Park household. But as their plan unfolds, they find themselves drawn deeper into a web of deceit and desperation, with devastating consequences.

The performances in ""Parasite"" are nothing short of remarkable. The Kim family, played by Song Kang-ho, Choi Woo-shik, Park So-dam, and Jang Hye-jin, are all incredibly compelling, and they bring a sense of depth and nuance to their characters that is truly remarkable. The Park family, played by Lee Sun-kyun, Cho Yeo-jeong, and Jung Ji-so, are equally captivating, and their interactions with the Kim family create a tension that is almost unbearable.

Visually, ""Parasite"" is stunning. The cinematography is breathtaking, and the way that Bong Joon-ho uses space and composition to tell his story is truly masterful. The film's score, composed by Jung Jae-il, is also a standout, creating a haunting and evocative mood that perfectly complements the film's themes and tone.

But what makes ""Parasite"" truly great is its social commentary. The film is a powerful indictment of the class system and the ways in which it perpetuates inequality and injustice. It examines the relationship between the haves and the have-nots with a searing intensity, and it does so with an incredible sense of humanity and empathy.

In the end, ""Parasite"" is a work of genius. It is a film that challenges the viewer to think deeply about the world we live in and the ways in which we perpetuate inequality and injustice. With its unforgettable characters, stunning visuals, and powerful themes, it is a true masterpiece of cinema and a must-see for anyone who loves great filmmaking.","Feb 21, 2023"
9,indescribable,"""Parasite"" is an immense masterpiece. A few days ago I started to seriously interest myself in the vision, starting to look at the various trailers then passing to the reviews...but it did not appeal to me at all. Then one evening I decided to see if this film is really a masterpiece as everyone says or if it is just an extremely overrated film. Well, there are no other possibilities, this film is just a masterpiece. This film surprised me a lot! The characters are sensational: very interesting, well characterized, excellently interpreted. There is not one character that I liked much more than the others, but if I have to mention a few, these are Kim and Ki-Jung. The actors are extraordinary, each one left something inside me. The setting is phenomenal, from the first image you understand perfectly the economic and family situation of the Ki-taek family and then also that of the Park family. I really liked the link with the title of the film ""Parasite"", a metaphor about what the Ki-taek family does in the film. I really liked the drastic change of emotions during the film: it goes from fun and tranquility to tension and anxiety with a scene, extraordinary. Bong Joon-ho's direction is fabulous and in fact it deserved the Oscar. Every award won by this film is extremely deserved. I really liked the choice of objects and the settings that always come back during the film. The ending of the film is incredible, I would never have expected such a turn in a film that seemed highly quiet. I have no other arguments to describe more about what this film represents in the cinema. Indescribable.

I can't wait to see it again.

. Rating: 10/10.","May 29, 2024"
9,Parasite(s) and where to find them,"With ""Parasite"" Bong Joon Ho goes for another exercise of social commentary, not unlike his praised ""The Host"" (2006) - for those who cared for a monster movie dealing with social issues. It wasn't for everyone, though. Both films are 'so metaphorical' as ""Parasite"" protagonist Kim Ki-woo likes to put it. But different strokes for different people, no? Certainly, the metaphors aren't on vacation this time around, it's just that they learned to profess some subtlety. As back then, Bong pulls out all the stops in ""Parasite,"" and while the former picture's literally Godzillish rendition matching its ambitions makes it borderline, the new approach is hard to skip. It takes on the shape of a pitch-dark comedy with coarse edges when it counts. One might as well let one's self get immersed in it, enjoy the ride and laugh along, relish its twists and turns before receiving a blow from left field. ""Parasite"" comes across as less pretentious, settles on the more down-to-earth (pun intended) side of things; it plants its seed with a much smaller dose of horror, is whimsical, ironic, even cynic at times; and it substitutes CGI for clever story-telling and cinematography measuring the highs and lows of the social ladder with visual precision. In short, ingredients for a less in-your-face, decisively creeping-up-on-you kind of comedy drama of caliber, falling into line with Bong's other early outstanding effort ""Memories of Murder.""

""Parasite"" is an all-out visual genre mix of the first order, as much commentary about western society's underbelly and upper class as it is a ghost story drawing from a long Asian tradition. Things are in play that have always been lingering deep down underneath and come back to haunt us, metaphorically - and literally. In that sense the film is as much a thriller as it is fun stuff and dead serious drama, a bit like an attempt at squaring a circle, and yet it works.

""Parasite"" is also the ultimate staircase film, to name just one striking image. This owes itself to the implied fairy-tale lore that at the end of the staircase - society's equivalent for the romantic rainbow - you'll find a pot of gold, right? It's just that stairs work in both directions, and climbing them up or down is less romantic. Bong Joon Ho makes staircase construction his art and builds them vicious circle-like. Consider this circle squared.","Feb 15, 2020"
9,"Suspense, philosophy and professionalism.","The movie ""Parasite"" is about a poor Korean family that finds a way to earn money by working in a rich family's house. However, more secrets are revealed sooner or later behind the kindness and generosity of everyone in the Pak family's house and among their employees.

I'll try to keep everything laconically. The movie gives a viewer a glimpse of a wonderful director's work. I really liked how Mr. Bong Joon-ho chose the angles and points of view in this story. Considering that the movie is a thriller, a drama, and particularly a horror, the camera ""flows"" and moves in a way that calms down the viewer and lets him/her dive into the film. It is also significant to mention that the way suspense was kept and increased was special. The viewer doesn't understand the concept in the beginning, but closer to the end, the curtain is moved apart. I recommend that you pay close attention to the majority of the scenes because there are some hidden clues and social problems in South Korea presented. One example is the social inequality between the rich and the poor and how inhumane people can behave toward each other. Lastly, the movie is special in the way it shows the differences in how people think about and contemplate their own lives. For instance, being rich doesn't always mean being smart. Moreover, the movie will definitely make your emotions ""mix."" To clarify, some scenes can be considered funny, others are heart-touching and scary. Do not prepare for something monotonous. One thing that made me dissatisfied was the ending. I won't implement any detailed spoilers, so don't worry. However, the ending totally twisted the way I personally looked at the main character and the story itself. It suddenly turned from a suspenseful drama to a massacre, which, from my point of view, didn't give the story more ""color."". To conclude shortly, I truly recommend this movie for those who seek a worthy thriller with a story twist and an unexpected ending. Therefore, it doesn't concern those who watch with great attention to details :)

Believe me, clues and details will bring you to your destination much faster.

Thank you for reading my review!

9,"""The The Parasite - A Timeless Masterpiece of Story, Concept, and Characters""","Parasite (2019) is a film that achieves something truly remarkable-it evokes a depth of emotion and connection that few films can. From the very first scene, it pulls you into its world, making you feel as though you're part of the story, almost like an unseen member of the family. This sense of immersion is both comforting and unsettling, as the film masterfully balances moments of warmth with underlying tension.

What I find particularly captivating is the seamless integration of Korean cultural influences. The film doesn't just tell a universal story-it tells a distinctly Korean one, yet its themes of class disparity, family dynamics, and ambition resonate across cultures. This authenticity gives the movie a unique flavor, adding layers of meaning that feel both specific and relatable.

The concept of the film is deceptively simple yet undeniably brilliant. It explores the lives of two families from vastly different social classes, weaving their interactions into a narrative that is as entertaining as it is thought-provoking. The storytelling is meticulous, with every detail serving a purpose. Just when you think you understand where the story is headed, the plot takes a turn so shocking and profound that it reframes everything that came before. The plot twist is executed flawlessly, tying the threads of the story together in a way that is both unexpected and deeply satisfying.

Beyond its gripping narrative, the film excels in its technical aspects. The cinematography is stunning, using visual metaphors and clever framing to underscore its themes. The performances are exceptional, with each actor bringing depth and nuance to their roles. The writing, direction, and pacing all work in harmony to create a cinematic experience that is as entertaining as it is emotionally resonant.

This is a film that lingers in your mind long after the credits roll. It challenges you to think, to feel, and to see the world through a different lens. Parasite isn't just a movie-it's an experience, and one that I know will stay with me for a very long time.","Jan 12, 2025"
9,Versatile Korean Entertainment Industry,"Korean entertainment content is near to me as I am associated with the culture and the language since 2008.

And this movie is undoubtedly the natural and humble display of common society and it's culture against the riches with a twist at the end!

Those who haven't seen this movie yet it's a must watch as it will be worth your time.

9,Are you a parasite?,"I was recommended for a long time to watch 'Parasite', but I still could not find the time. Let me tell you, the movie impressed me. It was shot very cool, stylish and spectacular. I almost got claustrophobic after some scenes. BUT, it was very, very unpleasant for me to watch everything that happened on the screen. This is a scenario of survival in severe conditions. Where morality fades into the background and a dry calculation remains.

Everything revolves around money. Money turns people.

It's a wonderful, multi-layered film. The left-leaning director boldly satirizes referral jobs, Koreans' love of loans, tutors, elite universities, goods ordered from America, and even the peculiar smell in the Seoul subway.

There are no unambiguously positive characters here: the poor, parasitizing on the gullible, spoiled and arrogant rich, do not cause much sympathy.

""Parasite"", however, is revealed in different ways: at first it is a picaresque comedy, then it turns into satire, then - almost a serious piece - it's just a farce, with elements of a thriller or even horror. But in the end, everything turns into the total seriousness and injustice of the very structure of things, disappointment in a capitalist society - which adds the necessary energy to this farce.

Everything ends with a cold waterfall, which refreshes and makes you think about important things.

Music, beautiful interiors, bright characters, camera work, lively atmosphere and thirst for profit make this film a serious challenge to yourself and makes you ask yourself the question: 'Are you a parasite?'","Jul 17, 2022"
9,Respect!,"Writer/director Bong Joon Ho pulls off another sharp genre film with a darkly comedic twist - after tackling serial killers (Memories of Murder, 2003), monsters (The Host, 2006), science fiction (Snowpiercer, 2013, the only one I did not like) and child-and-her-pet genre (Okja, 2017), it's time for the family drama with a dash of Hitchcockian thriller.

The poor but cunning Kim family infiltrates the rich Park family through a series of deceptions, as the Kims discredit the previous domestic workers to replace them one by one, fabricating fake credentials. However, the Park house hides a dark secret which throws the Kims' plan into chaos. To say more would be a shame.

This is, for me, Bong's best movie since The Host, possibly even since Memories of Murder, boasting perfect editing, fine performances (the great Kang-ho Song, Bong's long-time collaborator, plays the patriarch of the poor family) and clever visual storytelling. The attention to details is stunning: the film has a strong vertical structure, with the road to the Parks house ascending into the sunlight while the journey back to the Kims' basement is a long, dim descent; the two great windows of the houses contrast each other, with the Parks' showing a gorgeous garden and the Kims' a squalid alley populated by drunkards; when a Native Americans-themed birthday turns into something far more sinister, a character's face is smeared with blood in a way to resemble war paintings.

The script is worthy of these remarkable visuals and finds a miraculous balance between comedy, tragedy and tension.

9,Innovative! 🍜,"Now whe are here again, Korea. What can I say? Great movie, absurdum, criminal and black comedy, fits so perfect into this movie. Great actors, curiosity about what happens next, much excitement! 🇰🇷","Jul 7, 2022"
9,Best Korean Content,I really think this movie was beautifully written and produced. I loved the actors and the story was exceptional. I love clever writing and the unpredictability of this film is what keeps you engaged enough to read the subitiles. I can tell why this was such a well received movie because it really does make you laugh talks about different political issues and makes you think more about the world. The one reason I take a start off as I get super annoyed whenever I hear people whining and there was a lot of waiting in this movie which made it at sometimes quite intolerable to watch. I would definitely watch it again especially when I am awake so I can read all the subtitles.,"Aug 28, 2022"
9,Like a detailed mini series rolled into one movie,"I have watched Parasite twice and still have to watch it again to get into how deep and detailed this masterpiece is. This movie got me looking into Korean cinema and what a country of rich story tellers and new styles in film making. Distrust of wealth and authority. What we brutally see is a lifestyle that relies upon hired help: tutors, a chauffeur and, most importantly, a devoted housekeeper. A family who works for the wealthy family decide to move in as if this home where there own.

For me, Parasite is best described as a melancholy ghost story, albeit one disguised beneath umpteen layers of superbly designed (and impeccably photographed) generic mutations. Thrillingly played by a flawless ensemble cast who hit every note and harmonic resonance of Bong and co-writer Han Jin-won's multitonal script, it's a tragicomic masterclass that will get under your skin and eat away at your cinematic soul.","Sep 22, 2022"
9,"""You know what kind of plan never fails? No plan.""","FOLM: 9.0 Rewatching Parasite reminds me why this film made such a global splash. Even though it's a Korean film, the themes hit universally, so it's no surprise it took home Best Picture at the Oscars. There's a sharpness to how it explores class divides and human nature that feels both raw and relatable, no matter where you're from.

What strikes me again is just how spot-on everything is-from the casting to the writing to the direction. Each performance is layered and feels lived-in, with every actor bringing out the subtleties of their character's motivations. I find myself really appreciating the way Bong Joon-ho pulls it all together, balancing tension, drama, and satire so seamlessly. It's a masterclass in storytelling, no doubt.

However, there's one aspect that still doesn't quite click with me: the comedy. For all its brilliance, the humour feels a bit off and manufactured at times, pulling me out of the film's world. I know it's part of Bong's signature style, but it doesn't land as naturally as the rest of the film's elements. Maybe it's because I've become more familiar with his approach, so what might have felt groundbreaking for others comes across as more expected to me.

That's not to say it's not an amazingly good film-it absolutely is. But having watched Shoplifters from 2018, which touches on some similar themes, Parasite feels slightly less fresh to me. It's still a powerhouse of a film, just not quite the 10/10 that others might find it to be.

Even with that minor gripe, Parasite remains a compelling watch. It's visually striking, tightly constructed, and full of moments that stick with me long after the credits roll. For anyone who hasn't seen it-or even those revisiting-it's a damned good film that more than earns its place as a modern classic.

9,It's a film unlike any other,"I hadn't seen this since it was released and I am amazed how I didn't remember the ending correctly and that ""the plan"" hadn't quite worked out. It's a film about a lot of things, but a simplistic description is that it's about a family of poverty one by one overtaking the lives and home of a family of wealth, hence the title. It's a film about class structure, greed, selfishness, criminality, liars, the spoiled, love, envy and more. It's part comedy, drama, sci-fi, thriller, horror and as implausible as hell, but the ride is great fun. It's brilliantly constructed by Bong Joon Ho with a flawless cast. It's beautifully shot and it is historic due to it being the first foreign language film to win a best picture Oscar. This is a highly original and wonderful film, but I'm not so sure that Oscar didn't belong to 1917, another brilliant piece of filmmaking.","May 31, 2023"
9,Went out with a bang!,Really well scripted. Plot was so suspenseful and executed brilliantly. Props to the editing team too! The director dealt with some worldly issues with great dark humour. Would definitely recommend!,"Jan 24, 2022"
9,Parasite,"A surprisingly interesting plot showing the sides of the life of poor people. It describes what a person is capable of for the sake of a good life. An unexpected ending that makes you believe in the best, but do not relax and go to your goal.","Jan 19, 2022"
9,interesting film,"The film parasites makes you think about some life moments. This story is not typical for Russia and therefore it was interesting to watch. The title really suits the story! Many, of course, unpleasant moments, but tolerable.","Jan 19, 2022"
9,Bong Joon Ho challenges our minds again.,PARASITE is a true psychological thriller with a ruthless ending that is a must watch for anyone who is a fan of thought provoking films. I watched this because Bong Joon Ho who wrote SNOWPIERCER also wrote and directed PARASITE.,"Jan 28, 2022"
9,2022 still a Must Watch,"Extremely entertaining, with likeable, easy to understand characters and situations, we follow a poor family who finds themselves in a unique position to take advantage of a richer family. The ending was shocking but all makes sense in the end! There are many hidden symbols and easter eggs too.","Mar 8, 2022"
9,Parasite (2019),"Let's get one thing straight: Parasite is phenomenal. It's a stunning, subtle, and immensely powerful piece on class warfare and the nature of the human condition. It's also a tense, funny, extremely entertaining film that didn't feel its length at all. Go into it without knowing anything if you can; it made my viewing experience all the more exciting.

But with that said...I didn't really like the ending? Tons of details, character arcs, and storylines felt like they were dropped in an instant. And yeah, I know that was the point. But I'd be lying if I said the lack of resolution given to certain characters is something I'm happy about. Like, for how well set up and intriguing Ki-jeong's sociopathic tendencies are, THAT'S what you do with her?

I don't expect my disappointment with the ending to subside with time, but don't let that dissuade you from seeing this film. It's still excellent and I'm looking forward to seeing it again. It's pretty much everything Jordan Peele's ""Us"" should have been.","Dec 6, 2021"
9,Almost Perfect,"A very entertaining movie that focused on the social issues in Korea. Nowadays it is very rare to see a film like Parasite, that conveyed its message so well, yet still able to be entertaining throughout the whole film.

Overall, this movie is a must watch.","Dec 5, 2021"
9,Bong Joon Ho Directs another Winner,"Bong Joon Ho directed one of my favorite movies of 2017, Okja, and has done it again in 2019 with Parasite. A working class family worms their way into the lives of a wealthy family with unexpected results. Ho has written a sardonic satire which loses nothing in translation from Korean to English. Koreans, like we American counterparts, have a 99% and a 1% who look down on the rest of us with disdain. The script is right on point and the entire cast is excellent. Easily one of the ten best films of 2020.","Jan 21, 2020"

9,A slalom around genres,"Don't try to define the genre of this excellent movie. It starts as social drama, veers into thriller and gets a finishing zest of horror and nudge of absurdity. No dull moment and truly entertaining.","Sep 28, 2021"
9,Masterful,"Visually out of this world, Parasite is a very captivating film to watch. The artistry of Bong Joon-ho carries profound storytelling from beginning to end, rich of deep metaphors and allegories. This tragic but powerful and timeless cinematic masterpiece creates a beautiful but dark aesthetic, relaying heavy on the theme of inequality.","Oct 16, 2021"

9,"Shock-inducing whirlwind of events, delivered with elegant panache.","Parasite is a film of two halves, both equally interesting and captivating, but both powerful in their own regard. The first part of the film provides a slightly unsettling crescendo for the second half, the tension built by Bong Joon-Ho in every seen only compliments the beautiful cinematography of the film.

Parasite is intensely ""... metaphorical"" and everybody will likely watch this film with a slightly different perspective of the meaning behind such scenes. The film has intrigue, drama, exciting narrative, a unique story, powerful physical violence, and expressive themes of classism. Parasite is essentially a tale of two families (or is it?), one poor and the other rich, the films shows the vices and vulnerabilities of each family and the good and bad they do in life.

A 15 page essay could be written on this film, explaining the many profound details, images, narrative and outright dynamic filmmaking throughout, however, plain and simple if you want a shocking, socially relevant, frightening and bamboozling display of film that will excite and entice from start to finish, Parasite will provide this.

Parasite is the first foreign-language film to win the Oscar for Best Picture... there's a reason for that.","Aug 14, 2021"
9,Wow,"This is not really a review, it should be taken more as a collection of impressions of the film.

A film that wants to make a huge social criticism and does it very well for the first part and also for the central part and then gets ruined a bit in the final which makes everything too hasty and obvious for some things but also extremely incongruous for others. Let's talk about the plot which in general is brilliant and wants to tell the disparities between rich and poor but also how people can be fooled in a great way if you know what to do and when the film seems to have finished surprising it still manages to bring out something that keeps you glued to the screen. So to conclude wonderful movie but I didn't like the ending.","Aug 5, 2023"
9,I see why this movie won best picture,Movie did not have a bad storyline which kept me interested and also the way the scenes look felt like I was watching from there. The drama really begins at the end but it was worth watching it.,"Jul 10, 2021"
9,An excellent film of three halves,"We came late to the Parasite party, watching it a year after the brouhahah, and it does live up to the hype. Despite the universal praise the film received, I was somehow reluctant to watch it, but I am very glad I bit the bullet - the film was satisfying, informative, funny, sad and beautifully made. It's a film of three halves, part Roma, part French comedy of errors, part Shakespearean tragedy. The Roma elements introduced us to Korean culture which was a refreshing insight to lifestyles I knew nothing about. The comedy of errors elements are genuinely funny and very well scripted, with sass and wit and portrayed and directed with excellent timing. The tragedy is shocking but never out of kilter with the rest of the film (I'll say no more in case of spoilers, suffice to say, it somewhat vindicated my earlier reluctance to watch the film, but I am extremely glad I overcame that reluctance.). It is a 10 star film given 9 because, realistically, I doubt I will watch it again even though it is an excellent film.","Apr 18, 2021"
9,Must Watch,"I have very low experience with films with subtitles or are dubbed. This one is my first and will definitely not be my last.

Impeccable acting, developed characters, a dynamic film... What more could you ask for?","Aug 10, 2022"
9,Not a Masterpeice but...,"First half is good second half is just very good. But not perfect. Ending seems bland and it seems director wanted to just buildup to that birthday part violence and start movie credits.and this topic ""class conflict"" , why the hell Oscars always fanboys to this topic. Some people don't like these topics but you give a movie a Oscar and world will watch it. It was a simple good drama thriller that i wont bother to watch again(most probably). Some of the movie parts were 10/10 but only some. So i would give it a 8/10. I think its fair. And Symbolism in this movie is Dumb.","Jan 15, 2022"
9,full of metaphor,"This is a nice movie with full of metaphor. I don't say this is a masterpiece like many people say but I don't agree that someone say it is a mediocre movie. Personally, I don't want to watch this movie again because it is too profound. I felt uncomfortable after watching it. I think this is exactly what the director's intention and actually he succeeded on that point.","May 29, 2021"

9,A cinematic masterpiece,"One person's opinion can differ from that of another's, and therefore the word ''I'' can become redundant when writing reviews.

However, I'm going to make an exception to the rule here, because it's important for those who are concerned about watching a movie with subtitles to know that I'm not a fan of subtitles in movies. I struggle to focus on text for 2 hours, and I also find that I miss the detail of the movie. Yet I have still given this movie a 9/10.

Why? Well, because you will soon forget that you are watching a movie with subtitles.

It is a true masterpiece. A dark thriller comedy, so different to anything else that is out there. A real step forward for cinema. Superb acting, phenomenal cinematography, and a magnificent plot, so beautifully built. It's fun, emotional, and dark all rolled into one of the true greats.

Don't be put off by the subtitles if that is your concern. And absolutely do not miss the chance to get lost in this strange and eerie plot.","Jul 4, 2021"

9,Deserving of every award...,"The incredible story orchestrated throughout this film was breathtaking. The shifts in tone done just so so perfectly. The portrayal of the upper and lower class divides are so cleverly done, any doubt i had about this movie before watching it about it's quality then i can't remember them.

9,Brilliant,"There are few words to say about this masterpiece, this is a movie that in my opinion is simply wonderful. The plot is wonderful with continuous twists and variations, the direction is perfect, the shots are one more beautiful than the other so much so that even the smallest action scenes are more than understandable and the soundtrack is beautiful but certainly not memorable, however beautiful. The performances are perfect but unfortunately I have to make a small criticism but not to the film itself, if you have to watch it try to watch it in the original language because the dubbing at least in Italian made me not a little disgusted. Finally I can only say that everyone must see this movie before they die.","Mar 4, 2022"
9,A Tale of Class Conflict: Intricate and Elegant,"""Parasite,"" directed by Bong Joon-ho, is an intricately woven narrative that masterfully blurs the lines between dark comedy and gripping thriller. This South Korean masterpiece embarks on an exploration of class divide, encapsulating a myriad of emotions and social commentaries in its tightly-knit plot.

The film's narrative structure is a testament to Bong's storytelling prowess. It begins with a sense of light-hearted mischief, following the Kim family as they ingeniously embed themselves into the lives of the wealthy Park family. However, the movie's tone shifts gradually, descending into a darker, more introspective territory. The pacing is impeccable, ensuring that each scene seamlessly leads to the next, while maintaining a suspenseful atmosphere that grips the audience.

Thematically, ""Parasite"" delves deep into the realms of social inequality and class warfare. It is a poignant reflection on the vast chasm between the wealthy and the impoverished, told through a lens that is both satirical and tragic. The film does not shy away from showcasing the brutal realities of socio-economic disparities, yet it manages to do so without being preachy. Instead, it presents these themes through the interactions and transformations of its well-rounded characters.

Technically, the film is a marvel. The cinematography is stunning, with each frame meticulously crafted to enhance the storytelling. The use of space, particularly in the contrasting depictions of the Kim's cramped semi-basement and the Park's sprawling mansion, visually reinforces the theme of class divide. The score is subtly haunting, underscoring the tension and adding layers to the film's atmosphere.

On a personal note, ""Parasite"" resonated with me deeply. It is a film that stays with you long after the credits roll, urging you to reflect on the societal structures we live within. Bong Joon-ho's direction is not just entertaining; it's thought-provoking, presenting a mirror to our world in a way that is both unsettling and necessary.

In conclusion, ""Parasite"" is a cinematic gem that defies genre conventions. It's a story about human beings and their complex, often troubled relationships with each other and the society they inhabit. The film's ability to balance humor, suspense, and social commentary is nothing short of remarkable, making it a must-watch for anyone who appreciates the power of cinema to evoke, engage, and enlighten.","Feb 10, 2024"
9,"Stellar, Lives Up to the Hype","This film left me on the edge of my seat, fascinated throughout it's running time. The effort and genius poured into Parasite astounded me with every, single, shot. It does everything it sets out to do and more. I'm intentionally not giving specifics because you owe it to yourself to see this film as blind as possible. Then again, even if you know every story beat the execution on it's own is more than enough to earn multiple viewings. It doesn't take detailed analysis or film expertise to love this movie, but there's so many more layers to dissect if you seek them out. Just watch it, Parasite is a damn near masterpiece, and no matter your taste you will find a lot to appreciate.","Mar 2, 2021"

9,The most simple film reflecting society.,"""Parasite"" is one of my favorite movies. Although the plot that reflects social inequality might make it feel hard to understand, the movie is presented simply and straightforwardly. I love that the movie takes the issue of social inequality to the core of the story. The film runs by asking us to ask questions in our minds throughout the story: who is the real ""parasite class""? The rich or the poor? Or do we all have parasites inside ourselves? The film clearly shows the main point of the story from character quotes, character actions and symbolic expressions. More than that, in terms of production, it is good as well. Every point of view, color grading, or even sound effects are meaningful and exciting which make the audience more involved with the movie even more. In the first part of the story, the story begins gradually, allowing the viewer to get to know the characters mixed with black comedy that reflects the social system of inequality. But at the end of the story runs in a different direction from the first. There is something more exciting and thrilling. Overall, it's still a really great movie and a really good script. Because the movie takes on heavy issues such as class and social inequality to make it more understandable. At the end of the story the audiences can answer the questions that the villain of the story is not the poor or the rich, but the social inequality that makes people be a villain.","Mar 5, 2021"

9,I'll come back,"This film seems like all those I've seen at home without even wanting to watch a movie, it's so good, it catches you.

And I love it.

From the beginning to the end of it, we can see how clever this production is, how smooth, how well intended... I love that it doesn't threaten itself as a cult film by wanting to be a very serious film (even though it is) and leaving space for regular conversations between characters. Not everything in a movie must be relevant to the plot, sometimes we just want a long or short walk in the universe of the film, and that's ok too!

I want to thank the director for it, I love this style.","Sep 11, 2023"

9,Simply unbelievable,"It's rare for a movie to combine cinematic fireworks and social commentary in the thrilling way that Korean director Bong Joon-ho manages with 'Parasite', a slick home-invasion drama that mirrors the masks worn by its characters: polite until they drop the pretence. The director of 'The Host' and 'Snowpiercer' is no stranger to genre gymnastics, and here he tells the story of a poor Seoul family infiltrating the lives of a super-rich household through suspense, drama, laughs and farce, allowing moments of pure terror, quiet observation and baroque noise to sit happily alongside each other. It never jars as it glides from one state of being to the next. The appeal of 'Parasite' is simple and age-old: inequality, class, manners and how we behave to protect what's ours, or to gain that which we believe should be ours.","Feb 18, 2021"
9,Only thing that could've made this movie better was if I understood Korean.,"This movie has a little bit for everyone that I think makes this a good watch for anyone who doesn't mind subtitles. Personally, I actually enjoy using subtitles but my friends who don't regularly like them and were skeptical about watching a foreign film loved it as well. It's satirical, dark, at times it is heartbreaking, and at others it is thrilling. This movie works in key details like a magician doing a trick right under your nose. We still must give this film time to age but I must say that in my opinion it is one of the best films of the definitely past few years. The one thing that holds back this movie is an ending that isn't bad but leaves a bit to be desired.","Mar 2, 2021"
9,I'm so pleased I didn't find out the spoilers...,I purposely didn't find anything out about this movie and it was worth it. It was one of those films where you don't have a clue what's going to happen or where it's going. It's brilliant and the acting is amazing. I've not see a film like this before. The only film that I could very loosely compare it to is Once upon a time in Hollywood only because you didn't know where that film was heading also (I loved that film too). The Parasite was definitely a worthy winner of its Oscars.,"Feb 14, 2021"
9,Just Watch It!,"I mean from the first shot this movie is breath-taking, I saw about how Bong Joon-Ho storyboarded every scene in the film and it definitely payed off, everything about this film is amazing, the story is genius and as someone who knows nothing about South Korea it's really cool to see someone from that country making a movie telling people what it's like. I don't want to get into spoilers but I will say that the whole thing with the basement is just amazing. I loved this fil and everyone should watch it.","Feb 13, 2021"

9,Deep back door meaning,"I watched this movie with my family after my dad saw the good critics of it .

I particularly enjoyed it as it represented the Importance of the difference in social statuses.

The movie is realistic and doesn't really differ from real life.

It showed/demonstrated in various ways the true horror or rather reality in today's society .

I recommend this for family or in groups as you will enjoy more than rather watching it alone .I think it doesn't depend on the age but on the maturity on the child in order to watch the movie .

The perfect mixture of all departments gives us a picture, strong both in narrative and filmmaking. The story touches upon the social lines between the poor and the rich and easily weaves it into the story. The production quality is top- notch and the actors do a really good job in conveying the emotions. This is a must watch for any cinephile and normal viewers alike.","Jul 22, 2021"
9,When I first watched this film I immediately realized it will win,In fact when I was first watching the movie I had no idea that it was nominated for any reward. To tell you tge truth I am absessed with kdramas and because of the country memtioned in the movie I was expecting sth in that scenario. Of course it has nothing with kdramas! Very interesting and for me a little unusual movie. It evakes emotions (mainly negative) but it doesn't mean to be bad. In my opinion art is about evoking emotions (no matter what kind of). So in this perspective this movie is all about art.,"Nov 1, 2020"
9,A Brilliantly Crafted and Deeply Engaging Social Satire,"""Parasite,"" directed by Bong Joon-ho, is a masterful blend of dark comedy, social satire, and suspenseful drama. This South Korean film took the world by storm in 2019, winning the Palme d'Or at Cannes and ultimately the Academy Award for Best Picture. Its universal themes of class struggle, social inequality, and the human condition resonate across cultural boundaries, making it a truly global cinematic experience.

The film tells the story of the Kim family, a lower-class household struggling to make ends meet, who ingeniously embed themselves into the lives of the wealthy Park family. The ensemble cast, including Song Kang-ho, Choi Woo-shik, Park So-dam, and Jang Hye-jin, delivers performances that are both nuanced and compelling, capturing the desperation, cunning, and ultimately the tragedy of the characters.

Bong Joon-ho's direction is impeccable. He crafts a narrative that is both tight and layered, shifting seamlessly between moments of humor, tension, and heartbreak. The film's tone changes effortlessly, keeping the audience engaged and constantly on their toes.

""Parasite"" is visually stunning, with meticulous production design and cinematography that contrast the starkly different worlds of the rich and the poor. The Park family's luxurious, architecturally designed home, a character in its own right, is a stark contrast to the cramped, semi-basement apartment where the Kim family resides. This visual dichotomy powerfully underscores the film's exploration of class disparity.

The screenplay, co-written by Bong and Han Jin-won, is smart, witty, and deeply insightful. The film doesn't just depict the divide between the wealthy and the poor; it delves into the complexities and nuances of this divide, presenting a layered and multifaceted view of societal structure.

The pacing of ""Parasite"" is another of its strengths. The film builds tension slowly, with each scene adding to the narrative's momentum, leading to an explosive and thought-provoking climax. The twists and turns of the plot are unpredictable yet entirely plausible, making the story's conclusion both shocking and deeply satisfying.

One of the most remarkable aspects of ""Parasite"" is its ability to blend genres. It's a film that cannot be easily categorized, as it weaves elements of drama, comedy, and thriller into a unique and cohesive whole.

The film's only minor drawback might be its accessibility to those unfamiliar with Korean culture and society, as some nuances may be lost in translation. However, this does not significantly detract from the film's overall impact and appeal.

In conclusion, ""Parasite"" is a cinematic tour de force, a film that is both entertaining and intellectually stimulating. It's a movie that challenges viewers to reflect on their own societal constructs and the invisible lines that divide us. With its exceptional storytelling, brilliant direction, and powerful performances, ""Parasite"" earns a well-deserved 9 out of 10. It's not just a film; it's a profound social commentary that resonates long after the credits roll.","Jan 7, 2024"

9,Dealing with a traditional problem with modernistic method,"Strong Acting. Great Message. Gripping Drama. The film portrays two a whole different families in the context of class. One immensely rich and the other profoundly poor. The main storyline is based on the parasitic methods which the other family uses to make its daily livings. As my headline suggests, Bong Joon-ho has not missed the point on to which extent people can go to make their livelihood when they are poor. He has recklessly showed the gap between the rich and the poor. Poverty is an undoubtedly established and entrenched problem of the society but over the time people have gained modern tactics to deal with it, as shown in the film. Whether it is the Kim family or the Park family, acting is done significantly by both. Kims flawlessly played the role of a poor family who are smart enough and ready to fool anyone to make their sustenance. Parks perfectly played the role of a rich family who are decent and ignorant enough to be fooled. Every scene in the movie has shown the gap which has widened enough. The gripping drama is the main masterpiece covered by Bong Joon-ho. Lastly, this film will leave you thinking about its acting, plot and social message","Feb 15, 2021"

Super cool. Refreshing. Haunting.","Sep 20, 2020"
9,Such fine details!,What I loved about this movie was the story. A simple and tragic yet original story of some unfortunate families. It tells you the way people are ready to survive with and without having social insecurities. It portrays good and bad sides of all the characters.,"Sep 18, 2020"
9,Social satire which is worth watching,"Superb plot. Rich and poor divide was and has always been there, but the way this film has exploited the theme to bring out how humans at various levels play out their part is undoubtedly praiseworthy. A must watch.","Sep 20, 2020"

9,Absolutely amazing,One of the most amazing movie. Those who don't like they don't know about the inside picture of the movie. great job by team.,"Sep 20, 2020"
9,A great example of how we can never have enough.,"Parasite follows the story of the impecunious Kim family, and how the prejudice of greed and class threatens their newly formed relationship with the Park family. In many ways, Parasite starts more like a comedy-a rather typical film that some may even describe as normal but: it is in the second quarter when after the Kim family and Park family have become acquainted, that the movie begins to live up to its title: ""Parasite."" The film was developed in such a beautiful manner that throughout the entire film; I found myself constantly guessing what will happen next but; I was always happy to be wrong. When I think of Parasite, I think of the sheer variety within its themes and how calling it a: ""Thriller/Comedy"" does not do it justice.

Whether it was the unsettling tune that played at the weirdest of times or the thought behind every shot, the entire movie had me convinced that it was going to be like nothing else. Parasite leaves us with a rather uneasy feeling, not because the film was not enjoyable, but because of the way it makes us question everything. I believe there is a message that comes out of Parasite and my take on it is that: ""The act of falling is a lot worse when we fail to enjoy the summit."" So If you're looking for a film that does many things wonderfully different and will leave you with a constant thought in your mind, then maybe Parasite is what you should watch next.","Sep 9, 2020"
9,Very good.,"I'd heard a lot of good things about this film. People saying one of the best of the last ten years. And where I'm not sure about that, I'm sure it's a great film. You'd be hard pushed to find a genre for it. As it has a bit of everything. Really recommend giving it a watch. It's available on Prime now, there's also a black and white version that I watched but to be honest doesn't really bring much else to the film. Just felt a little pretentious. I've heard their also planning to remake this in Hollywood. So don't wait for that as we know it'll lose all the charm and subtleness of the original.","Nov 23, 2020"
9,Absolutely brilliant.,"Saw it in cinema twice. Have nothing bad to say about it. I knew Bong-Joon Ho from Okja, which was a decent movie but not very special. So when it came out at a film festival I decided to go see it and I wasn't disappointed.","Aug 25, 2020"
9,"After finally getting to see it, I realise this was the best film of 2019",I thought snow piercer was a pretty good film when it came out and indeed I still think the same about it. But parasite was outstandingly good. Never too predictable and never too far fetched. Took me a wee while to get used to subtitles as I haven't seen a foreign film for a few years. If only all films were as great as this.,"Dec 9, 2020"
9,Weird & Wonderful,"Parasite is like no film I have seen before, for a very long time, despite enjoying it, I was questioning just what this film was. There was comedy, obvious drama and a little romance too, but it all accumulates into a thriller. It's surreal, but brilliant.

Overall, Parasite is a stark commentary on the class divide within Korea, yet it doesn't paint either extreme as the lesser, the evil, or impose certain stereotypes. The difference in lifestyle and mindset is evident, yet putting these two seemingly amiable families in the same space displays the ultimate division. It's difficult film to explain to another, yet it's apparent why it won the Oscar for Best Film. Watch it, I don't see how anyone could be disappointed by it.","Jan 30, 2021"
9,Parasite indeed!!!,"A film living up to the word ""amazing"", from all aspects, bringing up issues like class-divide and showing a plethora of emotions and thoughts throughout the film, like irony, rage, selfish desires. The whole film revolves around the word ""Parasite"". The film clearly shows how one class leeches off the resources of the other. The poor and financially needy, taking advantage of the wealth of the rich, while the rich leech off the labor of the poor. A great experience, which gets over the cultural boundaries in a heartbeat. You feel immersed in the narrative, as the story unfolds. A must watch for all movie fans.","Aug 2, 2020"

9,Asia's generally accepted societal principles,"This movie depicts the cultural hints of inequality and respect present in most Asian cultures beautifully. To a certain degree, the 1% disregards the human rights of the help and considers them as just parasites; creatures that will do anything for a paycheck. Subsequently, money is the determinant of cultural status-not identity nor character. The conservative nature of this feudalistic mentality is brought to light with this movie, to which Bong Joon-ho metaphorically uses a symbiotic relationship between the two families. With Parasite, he suggests an egalitarian approach to status and respect, in which uncommonly practiced in today's globalized Asian cultures. The movie does a great job in breaking the barriers and presenting this message!","Jun 9, 2020"

9,Parasite,"""Parasite"" is dizzying, brilliant and completely unclassifiable. Director Bong Joon-ho is targeting an increasingly polarized society, where the rich get richer and the poor are left to struggle to survive. Clearly he has achieved his goal, the film is undoubtedly interesting, but it is also full of anger and a strong sense of injustice.","Jun 18, 2020"
9,A good film,"As a masterpiece sweeping Cannes, it is easy to understand and not dull.It is not easy to integrate commerce and art skillfully and popularize, but it has high artistic value.","Jun 2, 2020"
9,I can see why it won Best Picture,"The Academy is generally hestitant to give the Award for Best Picture to a foreign film, and this movie was in fact the first movie with foreign language to win Best Picture. Did Parasite deserve it? Yes, yes it most definietly did. The direction is amazing, there is so much meaning and symbolism conveyed through simple imagery. This of course ties nicely into the script, which I think is exceptionally well written. The characters are wonderfully three-dimentional, and the contrasts between the rich family and the poor family are pretty interesting to observe and think about. This movie's greatest strength however, is the way it portrayes the differences in the lifestyle of the two families, and how the moral boundries differ from person to person. Watching the plot unfold is endlessly entertaining and engaging. The movie also manages to juggle all the symbolism with a pretty straight-forward story line, and how it manages to be powerful and funny at the same time is beyong my comprehension. The one thing I didn't completely like about this movie was the ending. Not that it was bad in itself, but the way many character arcs were scrapped annoyed me a little. I know that that was the purpose, to showcase how plans fail and all that, but I still wanted a few characters to get better conclusions to their arcs. That is practially my only real complaint though, and it's not nearly enough to ruin this fenomenal film. It is almost the complete package, it's a wonderful mix of comedy, drama and thriller, and I highly recommend it to anyone that likes movies.","Dec 10, 2020"

9,some ideals,"In the scene of heavy rain, the director used the method of comparing montage to express the group pictures of the rich and poor families in the heavy rain. Lay the groundwork for the outbreak of contradictions at the end of the following. Isn't it ironic that Mrs. Park stresses that imported toy tents for her son in the United States are more reliable and sturdy than Kim Kezer's home in the heavy rain? Ji Yu family rushed home, found that all of them have been flooded, people in this time of crisis, rescue must be their most cherished things. Father saved his wife's medal in a hurry , and he knew that the honor was important to his wife. Son Ji Yu hugs the stone that can be transferred by his friend, he hopes to be able to transfer; and what is Ji Ting doing? She was holding down the splash on the toilet seat, and she wanted the last little decency in the house","Jun 4, 2020"
9,Suspenseful and eye opening,"A movie you'll have to do research on and find the little hidden things and messages, social themes are revolving around the film, one piece of the film connects to the other but, yet the characters remain distant in way of laying. A great film the beginning will have you wondering the ending will you have saying ""wow"".","May 15, 2020"
9,Gisaengchung,"On one side is the flooded hut, on the other is the birthday party. One side is the cold and hard gymnasium, the other is the luxurious and soft back garden. Money is an iron. It irons everything out. They rub against the net, live in the basement, and do whatever it takes to get a job. When you think they are miserable enough, the movie suddenly reverses: they are not the worst, and worse. If you are rich, there must be richer than you; if you are poor, there must be poorer than you. The gap between the rich and the poor is like countless walls, dividing people into 369 grades. This wall, regardless of the wind, the sun and the rain, stands still. Mr. and Mrs. park look silly, but they are still getting richer and richer. The Kim family is very clever, but they can't turn over. You think that if you find a good job and get a good salary, you will get rid of the poverty status. In fact, you are still 18000 miles away. You can wash off the sweat of your clothes, but you can't wash off the smell of the basement that has melted into your blood. You've climbed ten or twenty floors, and you may have just reached someone else's basement. They are worms, so they have a hard life; they are worms, so they can't kill anything.","May 15, 2020"
9,Ingenious story with strong drama tension and full of suspense,"It reflects the differences and opposition of the rich and the poor, and exposes the despair and helplessness of the underlying society.I think it does a good job of deconstructing the metaphors and themes of the story with attractive visual and audio premises. The theme of the movie is very good, and the shooting is also very clever.","May 18, 2020"
9,Destiny,"""The person who takes half a second to see into the essence of things, and the person who takes a lifetime to see into the essence of things, are doomed to be completely different destinies."" This line is the best commentary on the fate of the two families in the film. Maybe, but more often to know, people for their own birth, the situation and so on have a lot of powerless and helpless, who do not want to live in the sun forever, let themselves let their families live a happy life, who want to live in the basement rent, but also be disgusted with the taste of poverty on the body?","May 13, 2020"

The concept is amazing and it's hard to even imagine that someone actually thought of it. Parasite 100% deserved to win Best Picture at the Oscars.

9,Fantastic piece of Cinema,"Parasite is a phenomenal film with top notch acting and fantastic direction from Bong Joon-ho, known for the films Snowpiercer and The Host, this movie may be his masterpiece. It contains eccentric and interesting characters, as well as a bizzare plot line that should keep any audience thouroghly entertained throughout. I went in knowing nothing, and this is the best way to watch this movie. The less you know about the plot, the better. It won Best Picture at the Academy Awards, and rightfully so, I'd say. The direction is flawless, many characters and subplots weave together to create a beautiful mess of a movie. I love this film, and anyone who loves movies will love it as well. The reason it doesn't recieve a 10 is due to its disjointedness, which seems intentional, though I would have preferred it to be more focused and feel less rushed. This film may have worked better if it was about 30 minutes longer. Anyway, do yourself a favor and watch this movie if you haven't already, its sitting on Hulu right now.","May 21, 2020"

I am rich you are poor, I will always be a master and you will always be a servant. Every time you watch the parasite, you will get a new perspective in the story. This is one of those films that you cannot understand very well at once. The ending of the movie has been cleverly presented so that every human can understand it with his thought. The direction of the movie is so vicious that you try to mind each of the senses of the movie, even then you will be forced to give up. The movie's original language is Korean, but despite this, people around the world are appreciating it.","Apr 29, 2020"

9,It's my own opinion,"It's a masterpiece film.Directed by Bong Joon-ho.At the first of the movie it will charm you.But the more you go ahead the more It's mystery will shock you.The direction of ""Bong Joon-ho"" is very typical.If you once see this movie you can understand what type of Director ""Bong Joon-ho"" is!","May 2, 2020"

Because for me, the visceral point, the sweat you could smell on your born-poor self afterwards was gut wrenching.

The advertising for this movie was misleading, it looked like it would be scary somehow, or a very serious drama, and I was delighted to see that it wasn't, that it was clever and beautiful and funny and not too self serious.

Bong Joon-Ho is obviously a very clever writer and director, these performances were natural with just a small wink at the camera, and the set design was beyond beautiful. 150% worth watching again.","Apr 20, 2020"

9,A Masterpiece,"This film has different genres which makes the film unique.Overall, if you're wanting a movie of mixed emotions (comedy, horror/thriller, mystery, sad, psychological, etc.), this movie has it.The story of the family mixed with different genres and sub-genres such as comedy,thriller,suspense,horror is done seamlessly and quite brilliantly such that it feels earned. The shift in the quirky fun heist comedy to horrific edge of the seat thriller is the highlight of the film. There is meaning conveyed in almost every scene,every shot constructed with such precision with much deeper layers into it connected throughout the film,for instance, the Native American reference or the line that Mr. Park crosses that urges Mr. Kim to take such a sudden and extreme action.Such films don't come very often and this movie proves why Bong Joon-ho is one of the best filmmakers working today.","May 14, 2020"

9,tailor fitted for my taste,"Objective as i could get, this one really had everything right for me. i even watched it at the right time even if it was too late but i think it was worth it. i loved every frame of it and it delivered its message in the best way it could. dark comedy is one of my favorite genres and this further solidified it's position and worth in my opinion. i'm not a movie critic, i enjoy them. everyone in its own. so i really don't have the dictionary or the knowledge to throw big words, all i have is my feelings and they were obvious. thank you bong joon-ho for the experience. it was the best i've had in a long time.","May 11, 2020"
9,"Funny, Compelling, and Suspenseful","Far from perfect and most certainly flawed in certain aspects of itself, Parasite still never seems to be held back. It's funny, emotional, and suspenseful, all while remaining swift with delightful characters, good storytelling, and good acting.","Apr 11, 2020"
9,Gisaengchung,"The director played out a story about class differences. How funny the first half is, how sad the middle is, how scary the end is. The skillful director's skill and precise and powerful script make the movie watching effect the most amazing I have seen for many years. The problem with this movie is that the poor are kind and the rich are good. People of different classes are doing things that are very in line with their own identity, so this kind of superficial goodness can not be the bridge of contradictions at all, only make the contradictions deeper and deeper.","Apr 13, 2020"
9,Gisaengchung,"Three groups of families, a total of ten characters, everyone is indispensable. Put the furniture and structural features of a house to the extreme. The huge gap between the upper class and the bottom floor is materialized by the height of the living space. The scenes of going up and down the stairs repeatedly, though straightforward, are just right. What's terrible about the director is that he has excellent directing skills and the ability to write stories. When he conceives the plot, he always thinks about how to present it to the audience.","Apr 14, 2020"
9,Remarkable,Parasite was directed and written by Bong Joon Ho and tells the story of the Kim family and their life-changing involvement with the Park family. Well written and performed also technically shines cinematography & bgm are too good and there's not even a single lag it's perfectly edited. Probably the best experience in recent times. Its pure art resembles the modern society the emotions they had shelved are insanely exceptional a layered masterpiece.,"Apr 9, 2020"
9,Unforgettable,Just an amazing film on every level. I've seen it multiple times and discover something new on every viewing. Great to see Hollywood acknowledge world cinema with it's highest honour. Wow.,"Apr 8, 2020"
9,Brilliant movie,"Im very surprise by this movie, a masterpiece in his style. The best asian movie of all Time , give it a shot you wont be dissapointed.","Apr 11, 2021"
9,Great,This movieA miracle of a film. It feels like Bong Joon-ho's already extraordinary career has been building to this: a riotous social satire that's as gloriously entertaining as it is deeply sardonic.,"Oct 27, 2020"
9,Amazing ...,"Wow, what a surprise - was not really sure about that kind of Story, but after a lot of good reviews I have to seen it. Great movie, very good actors! A kind of movie, in my opinion, didn't existing before!","Apr 11, 2020"
9,Simple and innovative,"The story of the film is simple, with no clichés or predictable scenes. As we watch the film, we become more and more attached to the content transmitted there, the light touch of humor makes the film very pleasant. The innovation that Joon-Ho Bong brings in this script is spectacular, simple, but at the same time genuine. Even with very common scenarios and mediocre performances, the film is excellent, really worthy of Oscar. This production shows that we should not be stuck with Hollywood productions, get out of the box, look at the world, there are several other masterpieces like this all over the world without due recognition.","May 16, 2020"
9,"The upper class must be matched by the lower class, and civilization must coexist with barbarism","It is said that parasite won the grand prize as a result of the unanimous approval of the jury. As Asians, I think Chinese fans will also be proud of it. Fengjunhao's efforts and creativity also prove to the world that genre films can do good-looking and artistic, which is the most important contribution of Korean films.","Apr 10, 2020"
9,An unexpected favorite,"I went into the movie pretty skeptical - I'm not normally huge on thrillers, but Parasite pulled out all the right stops. The film was shot well, the score was impressive but not overbearing, and there was hardly a dull point over its two hour run time. Absolutely deserving of the acclaim it's received, and a must watch for those who enjoy social commentary and gripping storytelling.","Apr 1, 2020"
9,One Extra Point for Screenplay & Story Telling,"In the year 2019, Parasite a Korean film came out of nowhere created history in the world of cinema. The film needs no recommendation and any of my words would just not be enough to describe the aura of this movie. I'll just share my experience about the movie which was phenomenal and once again it has given me the reason to love cinema more. The film would take only 20mins to transform from something ordinary to Extra-ordinary. The film will keep you at your edges and will be with you for quite sometime. Everything in the movie seems around hitting the right note at right time, strong screenplay and direction are two of the main pillars of this visual gem. Hats off to Bong Joon-Ho & Han Jin-won for creating this masterpiece.","Apr 29, 2020"
9,Just Great,"I like the film, the way the director presented the family, trying to fit into an non realistic life, but the get exposes by the smell of the poverty.","Apr 1, 2020"
9,Brilliant!,Such a great and funny movie. I enjoyed it from beginning to end. This kind of movies makes me happy!,"Mar 31, 2020"
9,A masterpiece of modern cinema,"When I first saw Parasite, I expected it be a pretty standard Oscar bait movie where nothing much of interest happens. But from it's opening seconds, I knew this would be different. And boy, I didn't know the half of it. Parasite starts one way, and it goes a very, very different direction than you think it would. And while most movies would struggle to balance the drastic turn of events, Parasite manages to expertly keep you guessing whilst still staying grounded in reality. Combine the phenomenal plot with great acting, some laughs, and a shocking ending, Parasite is one of the greatest movies of the 2010s.

Final Score: 94/100.","Mar 31, 2020"
9,Parasite: A Must Watch,"For all the movie lovers out there, this is a movie to feed on, think about and feel on different levels. The movie is about a family trying to meet their ends and their way is unique. They try all sorts of small, odd jobs to earn their living until the son in the family gets a job as a highly paid private tutor and the life of this family changes drastically. With him, he pulls along his family and their fate changes. As drastically the good changes take place in their life, it falls apart quickly too. In a night, everything changes. Bong Joon-ho does magic here. From the very beginning, the movie starts with a dark undertone and ends in a manner no one would expect it to and that's what makes it worth all the hype and praise. The story-telling is amazing in the movie. The climax of the movie cannot be anticipated. This movie gives it's viewers so much to think about, wonder on. It very well justifies the title of the film and the viewer gets their perspective clear at the end. The drastic differences in the lifestyles of the characters is very well portrayed. Inspite of that, how each character has maintained the part they played is commendably shown. Their planning, the difficulties along the way and how they overcome them or whether they overcome them or not, makes the film interesting at every moment. No wonder how even the language couldn't stop the sheer brilliance of the movie from winning the hearts of movie lovers all over the world.","Apr 8, 2020"
9,The scariest thing about this movie is that it's real.,"The movie had a constant sense of elevation. Just when you thought things couldn't get any crazier, they did. Somehow though, it all feels super realistic. That's the power of pacing. Recommended.","Mar 30, 2020"
9,"beautiful, painful, strange, and wonderfully shot","You really can't ask for more from a movie. Bong Joon Ho tackles inequality with a wonderfully strange concept that unfurls like an onion, becoming stranger and more duplicitous as you reach the core of his ideas--never polemical--not that this reviewer is troubled by polemics--Parasite maintains tension with his usual spiking of lacerating humor. The weird core, the subbasement of the film, reveals itself with creeping vigor. Love.","Mar 26, 2020"
9,A Tour de Force,"This is quite a tour de force, scooping up all the prizes in this award season (so far). It begins as a comedy of circumstance but takes a decided turn into some unexpected genres. The story is surprising and multi-layered. Your allegiances will shift throughout. The acting is superb. I give this film a 9 (superb) out of 10. {Comedy, Thriller, Drama}","Jan 26, 2020"
9,Best Asian film,"The concept was very interesting and I liked so much the way they managed to get into the house.Although,I put 9 because the daughter was killed.","May 10, 2020"
9,Explicit imagery for what a parasite is and does,"The portrayal of a wealthy family getting ""infested"" by not only a poor family and their former housekeepers demonstrates the different faces of parasitism. First, the poor family is capable to completely get the trust of the wealthy family by being good servants though their motivations are dominantly evil from the beginning. A starting potential love between young members of the two families never has a true chance since it is always overruled by the evil inclinations. The thought arises that the wealthy house's architecture somehow supports the hidden presence of parasites. Now, there is a deeper level of the story: Mt 13:24-29 (The Parable of the weeds). The movie tells the story of many people in this world. It tells the story of indifference. We get good things in life and we are so indifferent and ungrateful for them, that at the end we get unworthy of them and only then do we start to learn the deeper connections of the world soul while we have to compensate for the suffering we caused with our indifference. We are never only poor sheep torn by the wolves. The wealthy family is as guilty as the poor one and a war of philosophies is launched that ends detrimental for both families.","Mar 22, 2020"
9,Masterpiece.,Parasite from director Bong Joon-ho is a very deep movie on a lot of different levels. There are many symbols and messages throughout Parasite that are harsh but true. The set design and acting work together to create masterful suspense that had me on the edge of my seat for the whole movie. I can understand why Parasite won the Oscar for Best Picture. Don't let the subtitles discourage you from watching Parasite because you won't want to miss this masterpiece.,"Jun 10, 2020"
9,Great movie. It was fun! entertaining.,"4d ago Its triumph at the Oscars didn't surprise me that much: this movie is simply amazing! You have to watch it at different times in order to get all its cryptic messages. Plot, storytelling, screenplay, shots, and dialogues need to be deeply studied. A flawless masterpiece from South Korea! Highly recommended! My rating 9/10","Mar 21, 2020"
9,BRILLIANT !!!,"Never before have I seen a film that's funny, intelligent, nerve-wracking and thought-provoking at the same time. I wondered into the cinema not knowing what to expect; I left with an urgent desire to learn *everything* about Korean cinema. ""Parasite"" is a must-see.","Jun 6, 2020"
9,A masterpiece! Everyone should see this movie!,"Definitely a movie you cannot judge by just watching it once. During my first watch, I went ""this is an enjoyable movie"" but then--once I got to watch it the next time, I came to see all the metaphorical/visual symbols that Bong Joon Ho ever so masterfully put in the production of the movie. As a Korean speaker, I did not need the subtitles but if you do need them, watching the movie twice (or thrice lol) will help you understand the movie better, because during your first watch, you can focus on the subtitles and during your second, you can pay more attention to all the visual details of the movie. Superb movie","Mar 21, 2020"
9,Best Movie,"Filled with amazing characters, beautiful cinematography, frightening moments, dark humor, and a timeless social message, Parasite succeeds on all counts.","Mar 21, 2020"
9,Masterpiece,"I absolutely loved this! The first hour of the movie it was more of a comedy but after that everything changed. The whole ambiance changed, and I was literally shook all the time after that happened. This was beautiful acted and so well done, I haven't seen a movie as good as this was in a long time. I have no points of improvement, everything was so well thought. This was a movie which took a while to get out of my head, cause everything was so intense. I would really recommend this to anyone!!","Apr 9, 2020"
9,Relationship between family lover,"Although the poor family is poor, the family enjoys it! The relationship between the adults of the rich family and the children is very tense. The son is pretending to be stupid. The parents are difficult to control (although they are frightened on their birthday). The daughter is not valued at home. From the scene design of the noodles, the daughter is at home. Status! Bong Joon-ho is a genius, since childhood, he reflects the contradictions of various classes in Korea (including family conflicts)! As long as you look a few more times, you can find more details every time, and the response is very reasonable!","Mar 28, 2020"
9,The wealth gap between the rich and the poor will be the Xinhua News Agency of Korea,"Bathing in the sun in the courtyard can evolve into an adult, and breathing the air in the darkroom will only lead to flesh and blood. Holding the stone of poverty can not be sold for life, and the smell of cheap can never be eliminated. Bedbugs curled up underground, using potions to open windows to sterilize themselves; hosts on high, using money to hire people to sterilize themselves. The rich suck the blood of the poor and rise, the poor live in the rich man's house, the ghosts share food in the same room, and the worms parasitize and develop enmity.","Mar 17, 2020"
9,A masterpiece,"There is a strong sense of moral contortion throughout the story. The rich did nothing wrong but people hate them.The poor swindle and wield a knife, but you may feel sorry for them.","Mar 16, 2020"
9,Gisaengchung,"The greatest thing about this movie is that the rich actually did nothing wrong. The couple loved each other, their children were pleasant, they didn't cheat, they didn't have cold violence, they didn't abuse children, they were generous to drivers and servants, they were really kind and simple, but you just can't help hating them, hating them, hating them.","Mar 19, 2020"
9,Great movie,"Starts as a comedy but turns philosophical, movie although in korean is easy to understand with subtitles","Aug 8, 2020"
9,The taste of poverty and the blood of wealth,"With his easy control of time and space, Feng Junhao's interlinked parasitic relationship between a poor and a rich family constitutes a social fable of the ""parasite"" against the antagonism and differences between the rich and the poor. In this sad and happy story, the film is not only seen from the despair and helplessness of the lower class, but also hits the nail on the heart of the class contradiction.","Apr 15, 2020"
9,good,This is a very wonderful story.I have a lot of feelings after reading it.,"Mar 15, 2020"
9,cruel social,"While lamenting that the film reflects the cruel social situation we are in, let's also think about how to solve the social problems such as the gap between the rich and the poor. Perhaps when the production of this exploitative capitalist system changes and disappears, it will usher in a fairer society!","Mar 15, 2020"
9,excellent,Bong Joon-ho's Parasite might leave you asking who are the real bottom feeders in the black comedy about social structures. There's plenty of food for thought as this picture is deeper than than what it may seem like on the surface.,"Mar 16, 2020"
9,Bathing the sun in the courtyard can evolve into an adult,"Bathing the sun in the courtyard can evolve into an adult, and breathing the air in the dark room can only walk away like a ghost. Embracing a poor stone will never let go, and the cheap smell will never be eliminated. Bed bugs curled up in the ground, sterilizing themselves by opening windows with medicaments; hosts in high places hire money to disinfect themselves. The rich sucked up the blood of the poor, and the poor lived in the house of the rich. The ghosts and the ghosts shared food in the same room.","Apr 14, 2020"

Standing head and shoulders above its awards season competition in spite of an obvious language barrier, Gisaengchung is the smartest film about class warfare for some time, and by and large the best of 2019. A brilliantly brutal masterclass in editing, pacing, writing and everything in between, acclaimed director and now household name Bong Joon-ho does for stairs in this ""pitch-black modern fairytale"" what he did for trains in 2013's Snowpiercer, and follows in Hitchcock's footsteps by taking the movie medium to a higher level. Raising his game with riveting and nail-biting sequences that rival, if not eclipse, the best of any English-language picture, Bong transfixes audiences regardless of background, race or social status, for a breath-taking and genre-bending 132 minutes that descends deep into the belly of Seoul's semi-basement dwellings in a metaphori-, no, allegorical movie miracle. Demonstrating commanding craftmanship with his scintillating, near-perfect execution, the South Korean director is not the only talent deserving of 'a glass of soju', as the oustanding ensemble cast shine brightly in this black comedy thriller, spearheaded by Bong's male muse Song Kang-ho, and dynamic camerwork from fellow countryman Hong Kyung-pyo completes the impossibly satisfying package, shooting every frame so visually rich in prescient themes that resonate with today's troubled times flawlessly. As close to cinematic poetry as achieved in the 2010s, this sardonic social satire defies genre, clichés and storytelling conventions for surprising narrative turns, gasp-inducing horror and hilarious chamber piece exchanges, all working in service of a filmgoing experience like no other released in many years. Best watched with no prior knowledge of what to expect, yet still encourages and greatly rewards repeat viewings, show this stunning feature to someone you care about, and prepare to have them left speechless by ""a comedy without clowns, a tragedy without villains"".","May 21, 2020"
9,Excellent Film,Terrific performances. Very much enjoyed this film. Beautiful camera work. The cast was nearly spot on. The direction was outstanding. Great work to all of them.,"Dec 31, 2019"
9,Unexpected,"Everyone says the film is about social class but I do not agree. That is just the setting. Like many Korean film makers the audience has no clue where the film is going. That is something I really appreciate. In the end it is not realistic, but entertaining.

Does the film have a deeper message? Yes, but it is for discussion. The poorer family seems quite able, but somehow unable to work. Why? Maybe because they have psycho problems (e.g. father controlling his violence). And maybe that is why many able-looking people are poor. The richer family is very nice. How often are rich people taken in like that? Well quite often I would say if the acting is right.","Feb 15, 2020"
9,Just.....Wow,"This is one of those movies that after watching you have to step back for a second and breathe. Amazing. Great acting, directing, and genius writing. Beautiful set design and a perfect score. And that peach montage I mean, just watch this movie. If I have one complaint the ending could've been a little tighter, but it's a minor issue. Incredible, deserved every award.","Mar 1, 2020"
9,An Intense Journey Through Multiple Film Genres,"To quote director, Bong Joon Ho, ""I'd like to say as little as possible here, because the film is best when you go into it cold."" That being said, this picture has it all, drama, suspense, mystery and thrills. It has an effective slow build that culminates to a tension filled conclusion.","Mar 4, 2020"
9,One to add to your list if not already on!,"Great movie lived up to all of the hype, definitely a must see👍","Feb 25, 2020"
9,Tight,"This movie was sick (you know like good). I felt like I was waiting for everything to come crashing down at any moment, it was insane how much you wanted the family to succeed in their endeavors. They were lovable, even though their actions were meant to be revered you felt like you could relate to them. This movie definitely deserved the praise it received. That ending tho.....","May 29, 2020"
9,Great,"Unbelievable, great movie! Lovin' it! I think, someday another country will remake this movie.","Feb 24, 2020"
9,Watch this Movie!,"Parasite includes drama, mystery, comedy, romance, thriller and a few more genre, which makes it so multilateral, that everyone will find his part. Some people say it could be compared to the ""american dream"", which isn't wrong, because a lot is about raising money and work hard to get into a college. But this is not the only background story. The whole movie is filled with metaphors, what makes you thinking over it and realizing parts a few days after you watched it. The pictures and camera angels aren't just good, they also imply a great many symbols, which makes it even more interesting to watch it. Sometimes it was a little too much for me, that's why I gave only nine stars. Anyway, if you want to see a great movie, Parasite is a good choice.","Feb 25, 2020"
9,unic,"Parasite is very well written and filmed, having many twists and scenes that leave you in complete shock wondering how someone managed to think about it, Bong Joon-Ho film has several genres within it, it goes through a very sarcastic comedy, for a terror, with a lot of suspense and tension involved, still being able to deal with social drama. This movie is stunning and completamente amazing, You need to watch at least two times to get all the inside things that this movie brings It is so interesting when someone it is able to do something knew and stand out this days, with the internet it seems like everything has already been done, and this movie was definitely something knew, the way they told the story and the shoots made watch the film much more unic. Beside all the action that this movie brings they also made a criticism about the differents classes, showing us the upper class and the lower one, how maybe a raining day was good and calm for you, but for others could be the complete opposite.","Feb 23, 2020"
9,Amazing film with mastery on tension,"Parasite is an amazing film which depicts social disparity in Korea with an incredible sarcastic tone. It brings forward the idea of the American Dream on a surreal atnosphere, with one of the most effective twists in cinema this year. Having the rock serve as a metaphor to the plot itself and how it progresses was a very smart choice by Joon Ho. 9.5/10, favourite scenes: The peach sequence, The opening scene and the scene with the twist.","Feb 27, 2020"
9,Shook,"This shook me so good my ponytail elastic snapped, it's a good thing I wore pigtails.","Feb 20, 2020"
9,A society metaphor,"This is a film you either love or despise due to its portrayal of social desperation. If you don't like this film you may have missed many artistic cinematographic aspects related to the whole story and the subliminal messages within it about an unfair elitist society. It can be considered a grotesque film that keeps you watching and expectant of the unexpected till the end, which is so thrilling because it combines the sublime with horror at the same time. As Nolan implied in Inception, one more time, we come across with a film that incite us to be chasers not of dreams but of our own reality, in this case, at any cost.","Feb 17, 2020"
9,Amazing,A fantastic film that holds your attention from the first frame to the last. I was totally captivated by the story and the cast did an amazing jobs of creating memorable characters. Loved the twists in the plot and the feeling that the photography gave. An excellent piece of work! Bravo!,"Feb 17, 2020"
9,A worthy winner.,For some reason the UK only got Parasite in cinemas in February so I've only just got the chance to see it. It's a great piece of filmmaking all around with great performances and a fantastic script.,"Feb 16, 2020"
9,Deserve Oscar for Best film!,"When I saw ""parasite"" it had already hit hard in cannes, and now it sweeps the Oscars. The premise is about a very low-income family that is getting involved with another family but of high class bringing unpredictable events. I'm not going to go into too much detail, but the metaphor in the title goes a long way and makes us think of ourselves as a society and who the ""parasite"" really is in this film. There are no good or bad for both the poor and the rich family. As for the performances, they are excellent taking the rhythm of the film and going from humor (often black humor) to very dramatic and intense situations, especially reaching the third act. The direction, the staging, the lighting and the staging are outstanding, as is the music, making a great choreography. This type of film was needed, making an x-ray of the most complex beings in this world and how we handle ourselves ... Humans.","Apr 24, 2020"
9,Wonderful movie,The movie is a little bit dramatic but it portrays the inequality in every society. Full of twists too,"Feb 12, 2020"
9,Finally getting some recognition,"Been some years now that I've been watching Korean Movies. Been trying my best to let friends know about how amazing some of them can be but with no luck, the language barrier and the different culture is enough to put off most from even trying. I'm glad I've sticked to it though. Old Boy was my introduction to korean movies, but Memories of Murder is what kept going back for more. Through MM I got to discover Kang Ho Song, who I personally think is an amazing actor, wont be exaggerating if I had him in my top 5, of which Al Pacino is #1. As for Parasite, dont need me to tell you that this is a gem of a movie that can't be missed, even if this is your first time venturing into korean cinema.","Feb 10, 2020"
9,8.5 but I'll round up for Bong,"I think people are too quick to dish out 10s and on the flip side of that a bit too harsh to give anything less than a 7 just to its popularity. This film isnt a ground breaking once in a lifetime masterpiece but it is beautifully shot, acted and written. With any film, I think you must give some room to believe the unbelievable. It's a movie. It's meant to entertain, to move, to inspire, to question. People dont get what the purpose of this movie was I dont think. For me, personally, it was meant to leave us torn. In a place where no real sides were taken, so that we question it constantly, never really reaching a definitive stance. The characters are not ones to necessarily sympathize with or hate so clearly but rather there to open our eyes and really think about how incredibly ruined and beautiful this world can be, simultaneously. It was deserving of the oscar over its competition and it is deserving of your full attention, as a remarkably well crafted piece of cinema by a very talented director/writer.","Feb 14, 2020"
9,"interesting concept, excellent performance","It's not a horror nor alien movie despite the title and cover. Nevertheless, the storyline kept me on edge the entire time. The concept is so interesting, even though it's common one. The development is very unique, and I was pleasantly surprised. There was never a dull moment!

Given the premise of the story, it was interesting to see the prevalence of the family bond in the movie. That aspect of it was very touching.

I found the ending good, but a little bland given everything the story went through.

Great movie, very psycho!","Feb 4, 2020"
9,Bong Joon's best work till date,"There are many reasons why Korean movies are a top notch and Bong Joon is definitely one of those. This Lynchian styled narrative is surely to take you for a ride. The movie starts with a light hearted tone but gets seriously dangerous with unexpected turns of events. The movie shows off the dark secrets of both rich and the poor and our judgement towards them. It's a confusing perspective for the viewer on who to feel sorry for, which side to take. Excellent!","Feb 1, 2020"

9,meritocracy type movie it deserve oscar,"Parasite is also a person who uses others to obtain advantage without doing anything in exchange . parasite is about poor family who are trying to get job in rich families home ,the son (kim ki woo ) is english tutor and his sister (ki jung ) art therapist and their parents mother (chung sook ) housekeeper and father (ki-taek) is driver . they are poor family but want to get rich so they fool park family to get this job. parasite is a success story and also winning everyone's heart ,it is also a top prize cannes film festival and best foreign film in golden globes. director bong joon ho is his seventh film and its too good . this movie told us about the ugly , brutal modern life . when someone lives out in the open and others are forced to live in shadow but everyone sucking one another's blood. this movie of director boong joon ho called it ""satirical black comedy thriller movie""so parasite is stunning movie and all characters are wonderful actors.","Feb 4, 2020"
9,Lives up to the hype,"I admit I wouldn't have gone to see a subtitled movie if it hadn't won Best Picture. Don't normally enjoy reading movies. This movie was worth it! Got drawn in immediately with the characters and stayed enrapt as the plot developed. No dull moments for sure. Did make me think about class and how the haves and the have nots lead parallel lives, with the haves not really ""getting"" the have nots. Loved this movie!","Feb 19, 2020"
9,2 hours of intense feeling,"Without spoiling anything, I'll say that this movie cannot just be watched. It has to be felt. The characters are all relatable in a very discomforting way, which is what makes this movie so intensely sad and beautiful. A great peek into an economic struggles that is often left unseen but might now be more relevant than ever.","Feb 19, 2020"
9,Nothing Short Of A Masterpiece.,"Parasite is one of the few films that managed to breakout into mainstream US, managing to score itself a well deserved Best Picture at the Oscar's, being the first film entirely in Korean (the first movie to not be English), to do so.

Parasite revolves around one single theme: Classism. Not only is the film a stunning visuals masterpiece, but with each minute the movie sets itself up for the incoming climax, one you won't be prepared for, nearly a twist ending that we all had an inkling was coming.

Parasite's clear depiction of classism between the working class and the rich is well portrayed and serves as a stellar must-watch. It's metaphors and foreshadowing will leave you questioning everything you already knew about the wealthy.","Nov 9, 2020"

9,Humanity's Parasite,"A 2019 south korean film that shows the contrast between two families from different spectrums of the hierarchies/classes and the how individuals can turn into parasites, the film also blended both comedy and dark disturbing tones very well, while also delivering stunning vissuals of the use of camera work done masterfuly.","Jan 24, 2020"
9,Class Division and Lack of Empathy - Is It Innate?,"Bong Joon Ho's tragicomedy that is a ""comedy without clowns, and tragedy without villains"" (Ho, 2019) is a masterful painting of the division between classes and all the implications and ramifications that come with it. Parasite puts us in the shoes of a low class family and walks us into the life of the elite, making sure to land both class' realities and idiosyncrasies precisely and delicately through the superb acting, meticulous production design and breath-takingly purposeful cinematography. Although the bold and blunt screenplay narrates and exposes our lack of empathy in dealing with people of different classes, refreshingly, the shot selection during a small scene in the second act shows the interaction of a house maid and her boss through the differing perspectives of an adult and a child. In this sequence the directory of photography first shows us the perspective of the adult wherein she is looking over at the boss and her maid and sees a clear visual divide between the two. When the camera shows us the same scene from the perspective of the child, no such barrier is present, and they are on the same side. Bong Joon Ho has exquisitely created a universe that mirrors the realities of his home country today without knowing that the same story resonates through out the globe. Through the chaos that pursues because of the interlacing of these two contrasting families both in the film and in our everyday lives, I believe we need to go back to the mindset of a child wherein we stop seeing people as defined by their social economic status and strive to see each other simply as humans.","Jan 31, 2020"
9,Good for me,"Like the title, the film is catchy and dramatic to the end","Jan 18, 2020"
9,Gr8,"First things first, this movie has an incredible cast, all acting their roles with precision on the more serious times and humour when needed. Visually this movie was solid, with the camrea set-ups being almost poetic. I love the idea of infulltration and contrast in this movie, the idea of contradiction is very prevelant and very well done. This also has one of the tightest screenplays I've seen in a very long time, every single peice of dialouge contributes towards which every setpeice they are trying to sep up. The humour of this movie was absolutley spot on too, delivering clever and defining moments for almost every charcter.","Mar 4, 2020"
9,Incredible,"An incredible piece of cinema, pulls you in from the start, superb directing from Bong Joon-ho","Feb 15, 2020"
9,One of the best movies of the year,"I loved this movie. The director has a really beautiful touch and the dialogue and plot twists had me constantly intrigued and surprised.

I absolutely loved the character of KiJung - the sister. I would like to watch a whole movie about her character - it is so uniquely nonchalant and self-serving that it is a delight to watch - you simply don't see or hear of people like this.

I felt the ending was beautiful and just ever so slightly rushed. Still the best movie of the year for me and a worthy oscar winner.

Rent it/ buy it and enjoy.","Apr 6, 2020"
9,Sadistic comedy and brilliant tragedy all bundled up into the best film of 2019.,"There I said it---It's the best film of the year for this reviewer, and it's the best film Bong Jong-ho has made to date.

But to be fair, I've yet to see ""The Irishman,"" ""1917,"" and ""A Hidden Life,"" so my opinion could change. Though, I can't see that being likely.

The originalness of ""Parasite"" is what sets it apart. ""Parasite,"" twists and turns to darker and darker places while still maintaining a comedic tone. There's ingenious visual cinematography and storytelling when it portrays the division of class between the wealthy and poor.

Class inequality is a theme director Bong Joon-ho frequently uses. You observe it in his other films, ""Snowpiercer,"" ""Okja,"" and even in the first film I ever saw of his back in 2006 with Joon-ho's horror film, ""The Host."" Which also starred Kang-ho Song who plays, Kevin's father in ""Parasite."" He's hilariously witty in both films.

""Parasite"" set in South Korea, is about a young man from an impoverished family, the Kims, who winds up with a job to tutor a high school girl from an extremely affluent family, the Parks. He changes his name from Kim Ki-woo to Kevin to impersonate an English tutor. He soon realizes this could be a way to get his whole family employment under the Parks, and the family makes it their plan to do-so.

The film shined when it cinematically showed the differences between class equality among these two very different families. When we see the wealthy Park family, the house is pristinely clean. A complete contrast to the Kim family apartment, which is a basement apartment littered with trash and infested by stink bugs, in what looks to be one of the poorest sections of the city.

If you like dark comedies, then you're sure to enjoy ""Parasite."" I've witnessed people who don't like foreign films because of subtitle-hatred still relish this film.

You won't see another movie like ""Parasite,"" perhaps ever. Well done, Bong Joon-ho.","Jan 12, 2020"
9,Love these kind of movies!!!,"Cinema at its best. Hi I'm Steffany. World Cinema has got to be apprecited. Enough of Titanics, and Avengers already!!","Jan 11, 2020"
9,So unexpected,"This is one of the most well written movies I've ever seen, it was just great! The camerawork was amazing. I also didn't expect this movie to be nearly as funny as it was even with subtitles I still laughed a fair amount. I really enjoyed this and only have one problem with this movie and it's not that bad, I wish the it ended a bit earlier, just a few minutes. Besides that the only reason I don't give this a 10/10 isn't because I thought it was worse than others, I just won't give anything a 10/10.","Dec 13, 2020"
9,Very clever movie,Brilliant way to depict the late capitalism era we are living.,"Jan 8, 2020"
9,An original dark comedy about class struggles,This is a well written and well perfomed original film. With a lot of repetitive cinema these day i felt this was something new. I felt connected and engaged with the character throughout the film. There are several well directed tense moments throughout the film. A popular topic of class struggled well portrayed. Its always nice to see foreign language films having worldwide success.,"Jan 12, 2020"
9,A very good Movie,"The story is very entertaining. The poor family infiltrates this rich and wonderful family is just like a parasite. The son of a poor family Ki-woo gets a job offer from his friend to teach private English lessons to a girl. Since Ki-woo's friend Min is going away to study he wants Ki-woo to help her. Min picks Ki-woo over his talented classmate because Min is attracted to the girl and doesn't see Ki-woo as a threat.

The story is very entertaining. It was thrilling in some parts and wonderful in some. But it was brutal. This movie was a lot. It had something of everything. In my opinion, the story outweighs the acting. I didn't find the acting extraordinary. It was good actors and they did their job but they didn't make the movie.

Another review I read said I loved the first 90%. I can agree. The last part is a lot. Things started happening after the first half. About halfway in the movie starts to get very interesting. And the tension rises. But the last 10 minutes I would have done without. I thought the movie left nothing.

I would recommend everyone to see it because it is something different. Though I would not watch it with children. It would work with parents but I would watch it alone or with friends that don't talk during the movie.","Jan 15, 2022"
9,Amazing! Must Watch!,Just watch the movie. trust me. A truly Masterpiece from Bong Joon Ho.,"Jan 2, 2020"
9,So much better than Lighthouse,"A movie with stakes, set ups and payoffs and an engaging plot.","Jan 3, 2020"
9,WATCHED WITHOUT SEEING TRAILER.,I will say this again and again. Trailers ruin movies. I watched this film after staying away from trailers. I have done so since. Suicide squad. Where I realized trailers ruin movies. Do yourself a favor and if any movie you hear about that you wanna see. Just go see it. Don't watch the trailer. This was the actual opposite of what I thought the film was going to be. And it was incredible. Thanks.,"Feb 26, 2020"
9,epical masterpiece,"This film is art. You need a moment to get the scenario but then you are caught in it. It is breathtaking. It's fun and scary, dark and lovely and just sad. This is perfect in every way. This might need to sink in awhile but it is truely a cinegraphic masterpiece.","Jan 13, 2020"
9,So many twists and turns I got whiplash,I thought I knew what was happening but it turns out I didnt even know what I didnt know. Cinematography was so well done. Comedy relief at the exact moments it needed it. My stress levels at a max the entire last quarter I had to physically cover my gaping mouth with my hand.,"Jan 11, 2020"
9,What the WHAT?!?!,"Crazy movie. Really, really original, entertaining, and shocking. I walked out of the theatre very impressed. Easily one of the best films of 2019.","Dec 21, 2019"
9,Definitely Deserved All of Its Awards,"This film is truly an accomplishment in filmmaking. Director Bong Joon Ho starts off with such a simple plot, and manages to turn the film into something really crazy, and quite suspenseful, which I was not expecting at all, especially after having seen the trailer. As for the cast, I don't really know anything about any of them, as I have not seen any of the other films that they have been in, but they all did a fantastic job in their roles. The main cast does a great job at portraying this manipulative family who will do just about anything in order to make a living, while the wealthy family's actors do a great job at portraying these gullible and complacent characters that have no idea about the intentions of the workers that they have just recently hired. One thing that I absolutely loved was the entire plot and how it was executed. I did not realize how crazy this movie would end up getting, I really thought that it was just just going to be drama between two families for much of the film, but it ended up being so much more than that, I loved it. No wonder it won all of the awards that it did, definitely one if the best movies I've seen in a long time.","Nov 10, 2020"
9,Near Perfection,"Just a masterpiece of filmmaking.

As far as pacing, dialogue, camera work, cinematography, and acting, I thought this movie was absolute perfection. Every scene and the entire film carries intrigue or excitement. Never a dull moment, or even a dull second, throughout. Just astounding; as someone else mentioned, watch this with a minimum of knowledge about the plot.

The overall narrative is also exceptional. For me, personally, there were a couple of elements of the plot in which I would have preferred to be different, which is why I give it 9 stars instead of 10. However, that's not a significant negative, just my own preference and it still is an astounding film.","Dec 11, 2019"
9,Super entertaining movie!,"What a creative film! I find Parasite as a wonderfully written story with amazing sequences of suspense mixed with a very well added comedy. What an overwhelmingly finale!, this may be one of the best movies of the year that i've seen by far.","Dec 5, 2019"
9,Amazing!,"This is one of the best movies I've ever watched. I went into it not expecting to like it or even watch the whole thing, but I was pleasantly surprised. The acting, writing, and directing were all perfect, but the end scene kind of overstayed its welcome.","Feb 16, 2020"
9,Unique,"This is one of the few movies that I have rated 9/10. It is the first and only movie to win the ""Best Picture"" award without having English as the original language. The plot is very well designed and you will experience almost every emotion from happiness to anger whilst watching this movie. The movie as a whole is criticism to the capitalist system which creates a huge gap between rich and poor people. There are two families in the movie that represents the rich and the poor class. There are a variety of references used in the movie as well which caught my attention and made me like the movie even more. Overall unique would be the ideal word to describe this 4 Academy Awards winner movie.","Oct 19, 2022"
9,Quite frankly brilliant,"This movie has it all. From a fascinating and creative storyline to intriguing characterisation, Bong Joon Ho captures the prevalent topics of greed and class based discrimination. Although many were not a fan of the films later half, personally I enjoyed the exciting, new developed dynamic that Ho presents. He entertains the viewer through immensely tense scenes that keep one on their toes - wondering where the plot is travelling. One can truly marvel at this accomplishment, and the vast majority of people will, I think, be perfectly content with the way that it finishes.","Nov 16, 2020"
9,Very well written and quite believable,"Was quite sure what to expect when I started to watch this movie ""all sub-titled"" in Korean. But before I realized it I was reading the sub-titles and watching the movie action at the same time.

The story line is well written and very believable for the most part, there are some scenes a bit over done but all in all a fun and exciting movie to watch. I'm no new to foreign movies, having spent 22 years in the Navy and visited 48 countries one gets exposed to so many ""different"" things and cultures.

I was quite taken by the line the movie took as it progressed until and found it very funny in some aspects but also sad in what the family had to do to survive. Then came the ""garden party"" and it blew me away... I didn't see that coming but it was a good way to bring closure to a number of things.

Very glad I took the time to watch it, I very enjoyable movie.","Feb 11, 2020"
9,Pure magic,"This movie is magically from the beginning and thrilling until the end. It's so perfectly detailed and the plot just damn good. If you want to see some poor family just wanting to live a better life and be thrown into a moral dilemma about the consequences of lies you're right here. Every character is unique, the screenwriting is excellent, cinematography A+. The only thing is the somehow open end... or is it?","Apr 20, 2020"
9,New concept movie,"This movie story is very much new concept story.. I can't believe one can write like this story.., everything in this movie is great.. Every upcoming scenes are perfect in it.. I think it has best story ever... Just go for it.. You will say.. ""Wah... What a story"" just watch it.. You will love it..","Feb 21, 2020"
9,Unexpected piece of art,"An unexpected storyline which tells a lot about society in South Korea or capitalism at all? Definitely different from Hollywood movies as we know todays, very artistic with well designed environment. Made me feel tensed like movies 20 years ago, , made me feel bad for the main protagonists. Apart from great storyline, very esthetic movie.","Apr 19, 2020"
9,Art can be found here in every shot,"Funny, Sad, Dark comedy, Drama, Shocking twist, but definitely, masterpiece. I like that none of them is represented as the pure evil or the pure humanity, It's just about the levels that the society created. The smell of the poor family is the same (because of the house, as the girl said, because of the level they live in) and also the rich family. The end was so iconic. Best actor was Kang-ho Song (the father of the poor family) he gave us A-Class acting. And also the others were so good but that man was something else. The director and the writer Bong Joon Ho made history. They say films are the history of our age and that man created such a great history here. On a mid day cinema with five other people in it, it was a great day when booked that ticket.","Dec 7, 2019"

9,Fantastic movie,"I had no expectations walking into Parasite, but now my love and appreciation for it has breached the stratosphere. This is definitely one of the best movies of 2019, and it's bound to be a classic.Filming a movie is like painting a picture, you need to put time and effort into it and boy the people who worked on this film knew what there doing.","Nov 10, 2020"

9,Beyond Brilliant!,"To think of such story is intelligent! This is a masterpiece, totally Oscar worthy! It has a strong message, that greed lands you nowhere. Also, everything and everyone is running after worldly pleasure, and no matter how much petty a rich man can feel for the poor, they always look upon them like som down trodden untouchable stinky filth. The highlight of the movie is its uncanny realistic background! This is every other south asian country, where class parity is so much!","Apr 2, 2020"

9,Splendid,"This is one of the best movies of the new century. All characters are real and to some extent relatable. While the movie is Korean and leverages Korean culture in many parts, the multicultural, universal takes what made this movie so great.

Most importantly, while the movie does make a lot of comments with regards to class differences, it constantly refrains from taking side or lecturing the audience.","Feb 11, 2020"
9,Deserve oscar by far,Amazing movie i loved it so much i think this movie is revealing for us the other side of movies we don't care about because it is just did not made in Hollywood it is legendary and i think i will remember every detail of it even if i saw one time because simply it is special. Great job.,"Apr 3, 2020"
9,Unexpected,"PARASITE RATING: 4.7/5

Heard a lot about this movie, so i finally decided to check it out. The name implies a possible horror movie, hell, even the main poster feels horror-ish. In reality, it turns out to be a twisted dark comedy that comments on the disparities between rich and poor families, and even how the gap between them keeps widening.

You're following this dirt poor family who struggles to just get by. However, there's no doubt that they all love and support each other. Miraculously, the son gets a job tutoring English for this rich family's daughter, despite not really having the qualifications. At this point, the son starts scheming up ways to get his family involved in taking advantage of this rich family, and hilarity ensues.

The first half of the movie is a straight up comedy as this poor family takes advantage of the rich family, that clearly doesn't know any better. My theater was laughing up a storm, regardless of the subtitles. Reviewers, and the director, keep saying that a twist happens in the 2nd Half, which should be kept secret. However, i thought it was just par for the course, and was not surprised at all when the supposed twist happened. As you enter the 3rd Act, things start getting kinda serious and questions start being raised about who's in the right. You have a rich family that's out of touch with the world around them. On the other side, you have a poor family doing whatever it takes to survive. There's even a small discussion about how easy it is to be nice when you have tons of money.

This movie has layers upon layers in what it says about the rich and the poor. Where Joker held up a mirror to society and said ""You are to blame for what happens,"" Parasite presents the good and bad between the families and kind of asks the audience, ""Who's worse?"" Yes, the rich family has it easy and seems to have it all together, but they fake almost everything about their life and are borderline disconnected from each other, and society, while even looking down on others, and not realizing it. The poor family is tight knit, but you start to wonder if they keep each other down because of how close they are. Even when the idea is presented that the brightest family member could easily transition into the rich lifestyle, the movie makes you ask if they should, as that world has a tendency to chew people up and spit them out. There's even a moment where someone in the poor family tries to make an emotional connection with the rich family, after going through a traumatic life changing experience, only to be reminded that they're nothing more than a lowly employee.

Honestly, this movie is great. It can be interpreted in so many different ways, and you wouldn't really be wrong, no matter what you took from the movie. This is a high recommend from me. If you hate subtitles, suck it up because this is a movie that's definitely worth watching.","Oct 28, 2019"
9,One of my favorite non-english films!,"This film is amazing, a little scary but it left me unfazed. There are so many plot twists, and it's incredible filmed. 9.5/10. Loved it, wouldn't watch again just because it's a one-time kind of movie.","Dec 21, 2020"
9,Masterpiece!!!,"I saw the other film of Bong Joon-ho ""Memories of a murder"" and seince that day i wached every movies that i could from Joon-ho and the other directors from his country. He taught me that no mater where are you from and no mater what is your background. All people around the world have the same questions about their life. After watching this movie you do not know who was the parasite. I even thought myself as a parasite.. I can only call this great movie as a masterpiece.","Apr 3, 2020"
9,Blew my mind,The storyline is really different. People don't get to see this type of movie often. The movie is really a lot to take in the storyline is based completely on the name of the movie.,"Feb 18, 2020"
9,Korean cinema at its best,"First time I watched Bong Joon Ho movie was The Host, a Korean sci fi about the rise of the monster of Han river. The star, a stupid, low class but determine man played by Song Kang-ho. I fell in love with this movie, and then I look for another movies starred by Song Kang Ho, I get Memories of Murder, Taxi Driver and another movie about world war 2 between Korea and Japan.

The I realized, most of Song Kang Ho's best movies are directed by Bong Joon-ho, which are not much. This guy is about quality, he doesn't make movie every year. It took 3 years hiatus from The Host to direct the next one, Mother, and it took another 4 years before Bong Joon-ho directed Chris Evans and Tilda Swinton.

But Parasite is another masterpiece. It's easily considered as the best movie of 2019. Forget the noisy blockbuster Hollywood action flick. Parasite is a gem, a real gem that only movie lover can appreciate. Carefully directed, smooth dialog, the theme about the class struggle, the acting, the plot, the craziness, the comedic situation, all you could not easily forget.

I fall in love with Korean movies because of Bong Joon-ho and Song Kang-ho.","Aug 19, 2019"
9,Watch foreign films!,"Before seeing this movie due to all the hype, I had seen very few foreign films. Not because I never had wanted to, but rather because they are not exactly easy to locate. Naturally since the United States is an English speaking nation, Korean productions and other foreign language productions are not advertised as grandly as say a Quentin Tarantino film. With that being said this review is an advocation for research and stepping out of the confines of ones comfort zone. In the words of the director of this incredible film Bong Joon Ho ""Once you get over the 1- inch tall barrier of subtitles, you will be introduced to so many more amazing films."" So let's do as he says... let's take a leap and do something out of our comfort zone. As this film demonstrates in unequivocal terms the leap is certainly worth it!","Mar 5, 2020"
9,Great,"I have never watched a Korean movie before, I really liked the movie and I recommend people to watch it. Great actors, great story & a masterpiece that you have to watch. The end of the movie is ok for me but I could be better","Feb 10, 2020"

9,An astonishing experience,"Just watch it people !! I assure you won't regret it. I love it how the film can move you from one state of emotion to another in just a blink of an eye. I laughed, shocked, confused altogether but I enjoyed it. I'm so thrilled watching this. I kinda wanna watch it again while it still in theater.","Jul 14, 2019"
9,Eat the rich!,Very good movie with a simple message. Eat the rich!,"Jul 12, 2020"
9,Must Watch - (8.5),"Watched this movie by renting from Google Movies.
It is difficult to say the genre of the movie as it has elements of mystery, romance, thriller, dark comedy, sentiments etc.
Story is very unique and exciting. It mentions about how the poor depends on rich and vice versa.
A thought provoking movie. It will make the audience think about the movie even after it ends.
There are so many hidden thoughts and meanings in the movie.
Direction is different level and acting is great.
There aren't much negatives.I would say the first hour of the movie is better compared to the second hour.
Final Verdict: Must watch movie which should not be missed. A movie which can be watched multiple times.","Apr 28, 2020"
9,Intellectual way of storytelling.,It's like taking steps to reach the top! The climax would blow your mind.,"Jan 4, 2020"
9,"EXTRA! EXTRA! ""Class divide sweeps the globe""","In this dark comedy thriller, the Kims, a resourceful lower-class family swindle their way into employment within the home of the wealthy Park family. Rich with style and social commentary 'Parasite' presents director Bong Joon-ho in complete control of his craft.

The cinematography works subtly to convey the rising tension of the film with purposeful slow push-ins on the characters. Even if the audience doesn't at first notice this subtle movement, we subconsciously feel the pressure closing in on the Kim family and a sense of foreboding disaster as their con is at risk of collapse. The film is filled with deliberate long takes, the smooth camera movement shifts the shots creating new compositions and keeps the frame visually interesting without the need to cut. This helps to give more opportunity for characters to share the screen building on the visual representation of their relationships. These long moving shots also function as a method of emphasising the scale of the Parks' house and give the audience the chance to gain a well-constructed sense of the space which is symbolic of the Parks' vast wealth.

The production design is immaculate and demonstrates a careful attention to detail, both the Park and Kim houses were sets constructed for the film and while they could not be more aesthetically dissimilar, they both feel equally believable. The locations of these two houses are also important, with a not so subtle metaphor the Kim family live down a street in a semi-basement dwelling while the Park house sits atop a hill. This vertical distancing represents both the separation of the families and their respective classes. Through this visualisation we understand that there are physical structures in place enforcing the separation of the classes, while the rich keep moving up, for the poor the uphill battle only gets harder. This idea translates in the story as setbacks for the Kim family negatively compound, forcing them into a downward spiral while the Parks' with their established forward momentum easily transform obstacles into positive opportunity.

But the movie is more complex than 'poor people good, rich people bad' each family possesses both good and bad traits showing a common humanity, aiming the critique towards the system rather than the people within it. The lower class can be viewed as infantilized by their idolisation of the rich, while the upper class may be considered child-like in their naivety towards the struggle of the less fortunate. The two sides of society romanticise aspects of the other, what then separates them is the ease with which the wealthy Park family can dip into that fantasy and return to their privilege while the Kim family are punished for their aspirations and attempt to embrace a more lavish lifestyle outside of their designated class.

In 'Parasite' Bong Joon-ho has carefully crafted a slick and evocative film that through excellent film technique conveys important social themes of the segregation of classes through the systematic structures of society. The film Resonated with audiences all while being insanely entertaining leading to a much-deserved Best Picture win.","Mar 10, 2020"
9,A very good movie that kept me engaged the entire time.,"At first the idea of a poor family full of con artists going after an upper class family seemed kinda been there done that sort of. I wasn't really into this at the start. Once it got to the halfway part, it took a very unexpected turn and the suspense kicked in big time. I suppose the best way for me to describe it is like a snowball going down a hill, getting bigger and bigger and then BAM! because that climax was crazy. I can definitely see why this got hyped up quite a bit, besides obviously winning the Academy Award for Best Picture. Good choice here.","May 31, 2020"
9,"Very well written, very well acted, and very well directed.",While I myself did not love this movie like other people I have to say this film is so smart on so many levels. It is beyond anything I may ever be able to do. While I may have not loved it liked some other people I still think this is truly one of the greatest movies of the year. 9/10,"Mar 26, 2020"
9,Good Story Telling,Amazing movie with a great story. Actors do the good work. Screenplay and Direction got highest marks. Music is cool and thrilling. Atleast one time watch.,"Dec 18, 2019"
9,Instant classic,I knew nothing about this film until I watched it. Thank god I watch no trailers or even read a description of it. I didn't even know the plot and that made it so much more exciting. Its split into two movies. Exactly halfway the movie a doorbell rings and it changes to the second movie. I was gripped from start to end. Anyone who gave it a 1 star just hasn't seen the movie. Probably one of the greatest movies of all time!,"Feb 19, 2020"
9,Gripping and astute black comedy,"This is a film that stays with you long after you've finished watching it. I still find myself thinking about some of the dialogue, realising there were little hints in dialogue and nuanced character actions that I missed the first time round.

The story of a family of impoverished con artists infiltrating the lives of a wealthy upper class family in South Korea, but with a few unexpected twists and turns along the way!

The story is a clever but straight forward black comedy, however everything about it is appealing. The sets, lighting and cinematography, especially in the house of the wealthy Park family are beautiful, and the actors playing the family of con artists are just brilliant.

You want them to succeed even though you know what they're doing is wrong, at at times they're just terrible people.

It's an absorbing film, you're either on the edge of your seat or chuckling as events unfold. At the same time, some of the social commentary is quite jarring which gives the film some depth and gives it more impact than a straight out and out comedy.

9,Great movie,"Parasite is an awesome movie. I would totally give full 10 star, but towards the end it starts to be a bit overescalated and in genreal, I didn't like the end of the movie...

I was not sure who actually the parasite was, the family, or just the guy in the cellar? Who was actually supposed to be the hero, bad and good guy in the movie? somehow I feel the movie tries to make me like the family and forget that they are actually the bad-ass...","Feb 27, 2020"

9,Mastering the basics,"South Korean cinema is taking more and more presence in the film industry, proof of them was the last installment of the Oscars, where the main protagonist of the night was the director Bong Joon-ho, who has made several films of diverse genres , among the best known we can find ""Snowpiercer"" and ""Okja, whose original language is in English, and are productions with original content, with details of great value that makes them hardly unnoticed; However, where this director's genius is really appreciated is in his films ""The Host"", ""Mother"" and ""Memories of Murder"", really outstanding films, full of surprises and unexpected endings, so in truth my emotion startled the find out that he made another movie, after 10 years since the last one!

""Parasites"" is one of the most acclaimed films at the Cannes festival and even won the golden palm, in turn was acclaimed in the ""Oscar Awards"" and won the best film, best International film and best director.

Like many of his previous films, he manages to put elements of comedy and drama, comedy is well written and inserted in such a structured way that he cannot take seriousness from the other scenes that were sometimes extremely dramatic, exciting and in some terrifying parts.

This film is the culmination of Bong as a total author, since he manages to link several genres in a total collision and thus generate the magic he looks for in one of his works, because ""Parasites"" is one of those works so well spun in its history and in the way in which it is said that he manages to wrap the viewer so that he cannot get rid of the screen.

Like all the great movies in history, I consider the experience to be better if you don't know too much about what you are going to experience (I hate spoilers). So I will not reveal almost anything about the plot, I will only mention that several genres at the same time, a comedy, then a thriller and even a robbery movie. It is a really ambitious film and there is too much happening in matters of messages and themes, it is also incredibly well acted thanks to the depth of the characters.

It is a really accessible film that can be enjoyed, because it is one of ""those films"" that you can show people who generally do not choose to watch Asian films, since it entertains you from the beginning and never gets boring, highlighting that It is taken with a beautiful cinematography, the music is fantastic with proper use, and all the characters add to the experience, making it not feel that time is wasted.

Movie I would definitely see again.","Mar 4, 2020"
9,INTELLIGENT MASTERPIECE,"I used to think this movie is a tragedy but on a second watch I realised it's a comedy. Clearly one of the best movies of the decade and one of the best thrillers of all time. The movie is very intelligent and very captivating. The pacing is very dynamic and the script is brilliant. The movie look beautifull, from production design to directing and cinematography everything was stunning. The set design express the social commentary about the difference between classes in very subtle and intelligent way. The ending was surprising in a good way.","Apr 27, 2020"
9,Painting Social Criticism With a New Color,"For me, Parasite is most convincing because of its confusing story, which is especially convincing because of its untypical pattern, so that it's hard to tell which genre you just saw. The script remains clumsy and at least gives me an oppressive feeling at the end. Moreover, the film is very nice to watch because of the staging and because of the convincing acting and set design you can put yourself in the movie's shoes and put yourself in the shoes of the characters, which are all put on with a lot of love.","Jan 22, 2020"
9,Superbly directed,A slow paced thriller that highlights the social class divide... superbly directed and esp a powerful development of characters... a great movie with little disappointing conclusion...,"Oct 17, 2020"
9,"Absurd, weird, unexpected - genius and intimate play!","I saw the film without any expectation. Sure, I watched the trailer, but thank god it was one of those rare unicorns that show the TONE of the film but do not anticipate the story line. Thank you for THAT, editors!

Bong Joon-Ho mastered the art of slow character development, complex world building and creating subtle tension throughout the story... yet I did not know what to expect (remembering MOTHER and SNOWPIERCER). I just knew: there will be a GREAT story inside - and wasn't disappointed.

Light, bright images, well constructed use of space and overall clean visuality suck us deeper and deeper into the character's game. They play it bravely, they risk it all. It never gets boring during 2 hours - many unexpected plot twists, executed well with the genre methods of suspense and thriller movies. He uses his main elements well. The story ends at a completely different point (perspective?) than where we started - I had great fun watching it.

I am still not sure if there's a political message or social criticism hidden behind it all - for sure it shines a light on individual fate and visible (and invisible!) differences between the rich and the poor.

Unexpected, thrilling and a lot to think about!","Nov 20, 2019"

9,👏😔,"Damnation on poverty, damnation on class differences, damnation on worldly regret, is money really the standard of human superiority !!! Is it true that the poor man has no religion and does not know God? And does the poor have no mercy on the poor ?! Is the poor more guilty?

9,An impressively constructed South Korean film.,"An impressively constructed South Korean film. The lives of the rich and poor become entangled leading to disaster outs consequences.

9,Brilliant !!!,"Expertly crafted, brilliantly acted, and inspiringly original, Parasite brings Bong joon-ho, Korean class disparity(which can be a little heavy handed sometimes), and international film to the main stage. Every setup, every edit, is perfectly edited to establish a whirlwind of internal emotion.A flawless masterpiece from South Korea! Highly recommended! My rating: 9/10","Mar 26, 2020"
9,Outstanding,This is an outstanding film with lots of fascinating subtlety. The cinematography is not only gorgeous but also conveys more about the characters. It has a great musical score that emphasizes the underlying themes and deftly ramps up a creeping sense of dread. The film seems less interested in making a socio-economic statement than it is with crafting a tight thriller that captures audience attention from start to finish.,"Jun 21, 2020"
9,A psychological study of the mind of the Rich and the Poor,"Director Bong Joon-ho has done it again. Although, still couldn't surpass his previous masterpiece 'Memories of Murder', this film is without a doubt, one of the best film of 2019.

As usual for Bong Joon-ho's film, this film is rather weird, which I absolutely love. The story is very original and smart. You'll find yourself questioning who's the good guy and who's the bad guy. Is it the poor who will do anything in order to survive, or is it the rich who live their life standing on top of others, ignorance of the people under them. While the film doesn't dive into the background story of the characters much, you'll still be able to grasp the motives of each characters through their expressions and subtle hints within the dialogue spoken.

Moreover, every scenes shown within the film is well thought out. The contrast between the two very different social classes within the society is well hinted throughout the entire film. I'm really impressed with the efforts the filmmakers put into these small but significant moments.

The casts are also excellent (and of course, that's include my favorite actors, Song Kang-ho). They all manage to seems very convincing in this weird setting. Everyone in the film all has their moments and they all have a role to play in the film. Nobody outshines the others.

Overall, this film did not disappoint. I can see why this film won the Palme d'Or at the Cannes. It's an odd but simple film with a powerful message.","Aug 10, 2019"
9,This movie took a turn,Holy crap this movie was fantastic I've never been so invested in a foreign film before. Go see this immediately.,"Nov 2, 2019"
9,Fun dark comedy,"It's really hilarious most of the time and with some sadness of reality on the class level in the society as well.

I've seen a lot of twist-ending mystery movies/shows so the ending isn't that surprising, but it's still a fun movie to watch!

Although it's shot nicely, personally I thought 1917 should've won the Oscar over this for best film though","Aug 12, 2020"
9,how sick/weird is this movie and still catch you in,"The only thing i would change on it ,is the end... , why the hell all that had to happen, the movie would be great with a different end.

Overall this is quit intresting to watch... , to understand the culture , the limits between poverty and rich people , there is more but i don't want to spoiler it , so it worth to watch.

The movie ended in hurry somehow ,not showing the life of Kim Ki-woo , i like that for the first time i see quality into this korean/chinese/japanese culture movies recorded .

This movie is pure fiction , but is not feeling like it couldn't become a real thingh , because doesn't look that unrealistic to happen .

I note it for 9 , because i would give it a different ending and a part 2 ! ,but maybe the director of the movie didn't had same vision as us tend to have .. , he wanted something sad to happen and the movie to don't end in just a happy end.","Jan 12, 2020"
9,My kind of tea for an amazing film~,"This film was incredibly well shot and thought out! It had basically everything to have in a drama thriller film. Its my first Joon-ho Bong film and my god it was perfect! I love drama, I love thriller and crime. It hit the perfect spot for my liking and the story was perfect and emotional throughout! The awards given to this film were well deserved and after watching the film I can see why. I think I have became a fan of Mr. Bong's films and im off to watch his other hits!","Jun 27, 2019"
9,Movie is... watchable,"This film slaps hard- go see it fool!

So the music is absolutely fantastic, the direction, the technicality, cinematography, acting, script- god this is such a great film.

I had expectations set high because of the trailer I saw for the film. What? The movie didn't meet my expectations? It didn't exceed those expectations either because those expectations were for a film that simply doesn't exist.

The more I think about it, the more I realize I enjoyed the film. Leaving the theater, I already knew I loved this film, but I keep loving it even more.

I simply can't recommend this film enough. There is a high chance you won't enjoy it as much as the hype is making it seem like the worlds best film of ALL TIME, but this one is a masterpiece. Go in with expectations, you will enjoy it. Remove all expectations and enjoy the ride- you are gonna have you socks blown off your feet.

Go see this one ASAP.","Nov 7, 2019"

The tension that builds towards the end of the film kept me on the edge of my seat. The acting and direction is superb. And the story will have you thinking about the film for days. I highly recommend this as I feel it is one of the best films, not only of the year, but of the decade. I can see why it was nominated and won several awards, including Oscars for best picture and directing.","Dec 21, 2020"
9,Peach of a movie,"Movie night with Iris.

Korean Cannes/ Oscar doesn't disappoint. Bong showing himself to be a cinematic master.

Parasite doesn't quite take place in our universe, but nor is it a fantasy world. This is the ugliness of class conflict shown bare. The parasites are every character in this film; rich leeching off the poor, who in turn retaliate by attaching themselves to the underbelly of their rulers.

Much of the story isn't told in words, but in the utilisation of space and the way people occupy it. The Kim family are often bundled into the same frame, perched awkwardly on furniture so they can all fit. Whereas the Parks always sit in separate rooms or sides of the frame.

The narrative will literally take you into uncharted territory, with a fantastic conclusion. Brilliant movie.","Jul 25, 2020"
9,wars of the classes,"We've only been through the middle of 2019, but I think that I can mark the fact that I experienced the cinema event of the year, or at least one of the important events of the year in movies. This is the film by Korean director Joon-ho Bong, 'Gisaengchung' / 'Parasite'. It has already received 'Palme d'Or' at the Cannes festival, and this time I believe that the jury's choice is extremely appropriate. 'Parasite' is a profound and complex cinematographic work, which does not hesitate to ask painful questions about the huge differences between the social classes and the deep prejudices that divide them in today's world, but it does so in an elegant and expressive way, with images. and characters who have a chance to remain in the memory of the spectators for a long time, causing them to reflect but also engaging them with a captivating story.

At the center of the story of the film are two families from today's South Korea, located at the two extremes of the society. The Parks live in a spacious and luxurious villa, full of works of art and surrounded by green landscape. He is the CEO of a large company, she is a spoiled housewife, the kids, a girl and a boy are even more spoiled. They are all surrounded by servants, drivers, tutors for children. The Kis live crammed into an unhealthy half-underground flat. The parents are unemployed, their children are smart young people, but with little chance of overcoming their social condition because of the poverty. The homes of the two families play a significant role in the story, the luxury and order of the Parks' villa hides secrets, while the claustrophobic disorder of the Kis' family home is similar to that of the family in the movie 'Shoplifters' of the Japanese director Hirokazu Koreeda. The destinies of two families accidentally intersect when the boy in the poor family becomes (with the help of forged references) the private tutor of the daughter of the rich family. As relationships intensify, cultural differences seem to diminish, the less fortunate family being equal or even superior in adapting to life and in the cultural interactions. Until about halfway through the movie, the audience is watching a social satire in a light style, a kind of 'rich family vs. poor family' story. And then everything changes.

A few weeks ago, writing about another Korean film, I noticed that many of the films that came from there defy genre cataloging and combine different styles into original and surprising mosaics. 'Parasite' is yet another example in this regard. We have here manifested social satire, melodrama, humor, love among teenagers, horror in the Gothic style, comments on art, a natural catastrophe, neo-realistic poverty and soap operas wealth. Stanley Kubrick and Yorgos Lanthimos are quoted. The natural tendency of the spectator to take the part of the oppressed in the class conflict that takes place in front of us is put to the test by the events that happen on the screen. 'Parasite' is an excellently acted movie, filmed in style, a story with many ramifications and meanings, which will not be easily forgotten by the spectators and which gives them material to think about the society and the world in which we live.","Aug 9, 2019"
9,"Inspired, intriguing Korean offering","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning

The Kims, a South Korean family including father Ki Taek (Kang-ho Song), wife Yeon Kyo (Yeo-jeong Jo) and son Dong Ik (Sun-kyun Lee) live in poverty in the slums of Korea, scamming free wi-fi from those above. Dong Ik gets a job as an english tutor to the daughter of a rich family, headed by father Guen Se (Myeong-hoon Park) and mother Chung Sook (Hye-jin Jang), before the rest of them weed their way in in various capacities. They get accustomed to a new quality of life, until a grievance with a disgruntled housekeeper (Rosie Peralta) who they wronged goes lethally awry.

Having had a three month break from the bombardment of regurgitated Hollywood, seemingly recession proof soulless dross, that fills the cinema screens, on account of them having to close because of the pandemic, they now find themselves in a position where they're losing money regardless (like they weren't enough already.) And so, it's even more reason to give this critically acclaimed offering of world cinema from South Korea, no less, a go. While a few notches off perfect, it's still an undeniably original and inspired piece, that gives some food for thought.

Director Bong Joon Ho seems to be attempting some commentary on the rich and poor divide, which undoubtedly exists in any society to some degree or another, and has his characters make some noted observations on this cold reality, with Ching Sook mentioning how rich people can afford to be nice, and become a little too trusting as a result, through to Ki Taek lamenting how having a plan is the worst thing to do, as it's the surest way for things to go wrong. Are these people in the state they're in because they're lazy and unethical, or does the system work to keep them grinded down?

It's maybe a little overlong, and the ending does drag on a bit, but it undoubtedly leaves an impression, and makes you wonder what other hidden treasures the Koreans are hiding from us? ****","Jun 15, 2020"
9,Totally Unique,"Usually I don't read reviews before seeing a film. This one, however, I did, and happily so. First of all, it was good to know what cinema in Korea is all about. We need to shed our cultural biases, including ""how"" to make films. This had a very clever plot and an engaging group of characters. The title, I assume, means the principle figures have managed to infest a body and then use it to sustain themselves. I hope to see more from this director in the future.","Aug 7, 2020"
9,An uncategorizable masterpiece,"What is one to make of the utterly uncategorisable and impossible-to-define Parasite? Only the third film to win both the Palme d'Or and the Academy Award for Best Picture, Parasite is one of the best-reviewed films of the century thus far and caused huge waves when it became the first non-English language film to win Best Picture. Co-writer and director Bong Joon Ho also tied with Walt Disney for the most Oscars awarded to one person in one night - four. On top of that, he became the first person in history to win more than three Oscars for a single film. In short, Parasite has had a significant, and relatively unexpected, impact.

But what exactly is Parasite? Described on its official website as a ""pitch-black modern fairy-tale"", even a comprehensive plot summary wouldn't adequately delineate its real nature - part comedy of manners, part social satire, part heist film, part thriller, part horror, part family drama, part farce, part economic treatise, part social realism, part tragedy, part allegory. And that's just the opening scene! It's the Ulysses of cinema, adopting and shedding genres so often and so seamlessly that it effectively becomes its own genre. And, like Ulysses, it's exceptional in just about every way - screenplay (co-written by Bong and ), directing, cinematography, mise en scène, editing, production design, sound design, score, acting. There's not a weak link here, in a film that achieves that rarest of things - it lives up to the hype.

The Kim family are down on their luck. Father Ki-taek (), mother Chung-sook (), daughter Ki-jeong (), and son Ki-woo () reside in a tiny basement apartment, with their only window looking out onto a popular urination spot in a back alley. With all four unemployed, they eke out a meagre living folding pizza boxes for a nearby restaurant. However, their fortunes change when Ki-Woo meets Min-hyuk (), a childhood friend who is now at university. Min-hyuk works as an English tutor for the daughter of a wealthy family, but he's soon to leave Korea, and so suggests that Ki-Woo take over. Armed with a fake diploma created by Ki-jeong on Photoshop, Ki-Woo successfully applies for the job. The Park family, father Dong-ik, (), mother Yeon-gyo (), daughter Da-hye (), and son Da-song (), welcomes Ki-woo into their lavish home, and upon discovering just how wealthy the Parks are, the Kims hatch an elaborate scheme to oust the Park's current domestic staff and take their places. However, it doesn't take long before things start to go very, very awry for both families, in ways none of them (or the audience) could ever have imagined.

Obviously enough, Bong's main themes are class division and class conflict, the artificiality of societal hierarchy, and the concomitant social inequality and differentiation in status that makes such a hierarchy possible in the first place. As thoroughly entertaining (and funny) as the film is, it remains, in essence, an economic treatise, albeit with a savagely satirical quality. However, make no mistake, this is a satire with teeth - the hilarity and playfulness of the long first act give way to a darker political vibe in the second, before Bong violently deconstructs his own allegory in the emotionally draining and completely bonkers third act, ultimately driving the knife home in an epilogue that's about as different from the film's early scenes as you could imagine. Of course, this is far from the first time Bong has dealt with issues of class, but never before has he been this caustic, this acerbic, but so too this compassionate, this witty. Indeed, Parasite feels like a culmination, the film to which he's been building for his entire career.

One of the most deftly-handled elements of the film is Bong's avoidance of the clichés one so often finds in films dealing with economics - the Kims are by no means the default protagonists, a victimised family immediately worthy of sympathy, whilst the Parks are by no means the default antagonists, a callous family immediately worthy of scorn. Rather, the Parks are depicted as perfectly friendly and pleasant whilst the Kims are shown to be liars and scoundrels. Indeed, it's the Kims who are the more crassly materialistic of the two families - as they ingratiate themselves with the Parks and acquire more and more access to a wealthy lifestyle, all four Kims start to carry themselves differently, as if being in such proximity to wealth has had a physiological effect.

There are no heroes and villains here - Bong is uninterested in trucking in black and white oppositions because such rigid diametrics aren't the norm in the real world. For all their scheming and lying, the Kims merely con their way into menial jobs, trying to earn enough to make survival a little easier. As for the Parks, their wealth has insulated them from the world of families such as the Kims, but their greatest crimes are disconnection and ignorance, nothing more. At the same time, the Kims are depicted as a far more unified and loving family than the Parks. Although all four Kims regularly occupy the same frame, to the best of my recollection, we never see the four Parks together in the same shot. It's a wonderful bit of cinematic shorthand to convey a thematic point, with Bong utilising the visual component of the medium to maximum effect.

It's in relation to the two family's status as heroes or villains that the film's title is so important. A parasitic organism lives in or on a host and takes its nourishment from that host. A simple reading of this is that the Kims are the parasites and the Parks are the hosts, with the Kims feeding off the Parks' wealth and status. However, in a film where nothing is as it seems, things aren't that simple. Bong depicts the Parks as parasites as well - they've been rendered relatively helpless by their wealth, unable to complete basic tasks such as driving or cleaning without the assistant of working-class employees; i.e. they sustain themselves based off of the labour of their servants. And so, just as the Kims feed off the Parks, the Parks feed off the Kims, in what quickly becomes a symbiotic relationship.

However, as strong as the film is narratively and thematically, it also has an aesthetic design to die for. 's cinematography, for example, is magnificent. Hong also shot the superb , and the camerawork here has a similar smoothness and restlessness, gliding through the Parks house like it's a fifth member of the Kim family. 's production design is also praise-worthy, with the Kims' and Parks' living conditions contrasted in every way; the Parks live in a pristine post-modernist semi-open plan house, accessible only by an electronically controlled gate, and hidden from the street by tall trees and dense shrubs; the Kims, on the other hand, live in a cluttered and dilapidated apartment with barely any room, their toilet situated beside the aforementioned window looking into an alley.

It's also in relation to production design wherein one of the film's best metaphors is to be found, which is also a great example of just how completely Bong is in control of his craft. As a film at least partly in the tradition of the ""upstairs/downstairs"" subgenre, Bong literalises the separation between those above and those below insofar as stairways are a recurring motif. The Kims live in a basement apartment without stairs, mirroring their inability to rise in a socio-economic sense. On the other hand, the Parks' lavish home has two main stairways - one going up, the other going down into the cellar. As Ki-jeong and Ki-woo gain more access to Da-song and Da-hye, they start to spend most of their time upstairs. Ki-taek and Chung-sook, however, along with Dong-ik and Yeon-gyo, spend most of their time downstairs, indicating a fissure between the adults and their children. The stairway to the cellar is its own unique animal, with Bong shooting it like he's suddenly directing a horror film (there's a thematic reason for this that I can't go into without spoilers). In this way, he bestows upon it an ominousness that, at first, makes little sense, but ultimately reveals itself to be a spectacular bit of foreshadowing. There's also a third stairway in the Park home, one not revealed until late in the second act, but one which will have huge narrative and thematic importance.

Parasite is a masterpiece, with Bong, operating at the peak of his abilities, never putting a foot wrong. It could have been a self-serving and didactic message-movie - a homily to the honour of the poor or a deconstruction of the unhappiness of the rich - but Bong is far too talented for that, allowing the film to find its own space. Quite unlike anything I've ever seen, it works as allegory just as well as it works as social realism just as well as it works as comedy just as well as it works as tragedy, and so on. This is cinema as art, a film which has proven itself very much a game-changer and completely deserving of every bit of praise it's received.","Feb 21, 2020"
9,Income Inequality: The Movie,"This fascinating South Korean film starts with a poor family scheming to get jobs with a rich family but eventually becomes something much darker and weirder. A very pointed exploration of the class/wealth divide, the movie is not just about personal tragedy but about societal tragedy.

At the same time, it's also at times quite funny and exciting, and it's beautifully shot and acted.

Thought-provoking and compelling, it's that rare movie that actually deserved all the awards it won.","Mar 2, 2020"
8,The emotional truth of class struggle,"Being poor sucks and there is no poetry in misery: it stunts your emotional and sometimes even physical growth. Sometimes you can fight back and improve, sometimes you are just have to suck it up and surrender, which makes you bitter and angry.

8,"A Great film, but...","Although its a good piece of film making, I have some points to raise... The thing with ""parasite"" is that it puts one random unexpected event after the other, and sometimes it works pretty well, but sometimes it doens't... you reach the end and you wonder why dit it happened this way... maybe I ditn't get something, but this is what I got from the film...","Feb 22, 2020"

8,Solid film in the genre of Fargo.,"I just saw the film and I went in unsure if it'd be as good as the hype. The film was enjoyable; everything was solid from story, character development, cinematography, editing. The film had a good flow and plenty of surprises. There certainly was deeper meanings to the film and great exposure to the Korean culture. The problem with this film isn't the film at all but those reviewing it. For those that swoon about the film or those that call it awful are way off base. The film is neither; and it certainly isn't a Tarantino violent style film. It is a good film I'd probably see a couple more times to find all the different angles of this complex story. It won best picture for good reason but it certainly didn't bury the competition; any of those could have won depending on what the viewer was looking for. It's a good film and should be seen and likely more than once.","Feb 22, 2020"
8,"It's good, but it is not surpass ""Memories of Murder""","Objectively speaking, this film is not as good as ""Memories of Murder""and ""Mother"". It is a good movie. But I have to say that if ""Burning"" is in Cannes this year, ""Parasite"" may not win the prize. This is the kind of movie that you think is good after watching it, but you are not interested in watching it again. Bong Joon-ho is a master of genre, but this movie obviously cannot be his best.","Aug 16, 2019"
8,Movie that everyone should watch.,This movie plot shows us about the interaction between two families in which one poor family acts as parasite to the one rich family. The plot of this story is appreciating with a new concept.,"Apr 2, 2020"
8,First time I've agreed with the Academy in recent memory. Amazing!,"This movie was a treat. I had heard from friends that it was a pleasant surprise. Went into it expecting a thriller, got so much more. It was funny, heart-warming, scary. It did fill all the boxes. Worthy of the BEST PIC award. No agendas. No silliness. Just good writing and a well-spun plot. We loved it!","Feb 18, 2020"
8,Upstairs Downstairs,"Highly recommended! A refreshing and unconventional genre-mix of comedy, drama and thriller elements, based on a strong social commentary about still existing class struggles in highly industrialized societies. Sounds a bit weird? Well, yes it is, but that makes all the fun of it, especially when serving here as a great example for the importance of intelligent screen-writing. A highly inspired ensemble of actors join and you have the surprise-of-the -year-film!","Oct 21, 2019"
8,Different storyline,"Depicts the life, thinking and work culture of people living in a slum in a very crude sense.","May 6, 2020"
8,Poverty,"I guess people can never fully understand poverty and what it can do to people. This is a very very powerful film. Very clever. But even this film can't depict the real poverty. If you've watched it and are reading this very review, you ain't poor. The real poor don't watch this film. This film might have depicted struggles. But real life is on another level.

And no I don't know what it's like either. But I can get a good taste of that idea when seeing the predators in the wild showing that numb gaze when they bites the neck of their prey. On their fierce face I don't see any extra thoughts. No concerns about ethnicity, pain or morality. But the absolute focus to end this hunt as quick as possible so that it could become dinner.

There isn't any flamboyance in that. There is only straight up desire. And the feed for that desire.","Jan 17, 2020"
8,just watch it,"This is one of the best movies of this year , what i like about it is that from the very beggining until the end you never blink an eye , the events getting more exciting as you watch , and the idea of the movie is brilliant , classism in this movie is perfectly displayed and the idea is different , i really enjoyed it and highly recommand it","Nov 4, 2019"
8,An interesting and a simple film which could have been more detailed,The film Parasite has a simple story produced in the simplest of ways. I liked the cast and also how they fit into the characters. One thing I felt the film could have done better could have been to put more background for both the families which could have made the story more clear.,"Feb 28, 2022"
8,"buckle up, it fast and pretty dense","It was a really tight movie, well written. At that phases they barely miss a glimpse of stories. Personally i think there's a really conversation that seems not really needed but the rest was perfect.

the scene was good in every aspect that i understand, pay attention to every scene and you may end up surprise with the detail that gave. Tone was really beautiful. scene story portions was easy to understand.

my first thought from the poster was it can be really dark, but well you'll see... it will be nice if we got a little picture post event from Ki-woo best-friend to see how he react after all of this.","Aug 21, 2019"
8,A Very Cynical Movie,"The Movie have a few very interessting situations, in which the audience don't know if it should laugh or be serious. It's a Arthouse Movie and not a Blockbuster with very much action in it. The camera, the location and the story of the movie a very good. The house of the rich family reminds me a little bit at the house in the movie ""Ex Machina"". The style of the movie is similiar to other korean movies like ""Burning"" or ""Oldboy"".","Oct 21, 2019"
8,It's a nice movie.,During the Coronavirus Quarantine I've watch this movie although it's in Korean i still liked the movie.,"May 13, 2020"
8,One of the Best of 2019,"I'm a fan of Joon-ho Bong's films, although I haven't seen one of his most famous films, ""Memories of Murder."" I was very excited to see this movie with my wife, who, uncharacteristically, was interested in a foreign art film.

There's a lot going on in this movie so I am afraid my own exploration of it here, will only scratch the surface of what there is to say about it. I'll only briefly mention the cinematography which is just wonderful. This is Joon-ho unleashed from the bonds of entertainment that are part and parcel with a film that is released on Netflix (Okja) or in American theaters (Snowpiercer.) Here, he can luxuriate with height imagery ranging from subterranean staircases to winding city streets descending into the slums in order to sub-textually communicate ideas to his audience and he does it with subtle panache'.

What I think the average movie goer will appreciate most about this film is the dichotomy of humor and terror in the characters, acting, script, and general 'feel' of the film. It is certainly the most jarring turn of atmosphere I have seen in a film this year and one that I like to imagine every one who watches this film will enjoy and experience as a true revelation.

The themes of class struggle and survival all writ large in this film. From the beginning where we see the poor as they seek to find the means to sustain their lives by abandoning their true identities to be whatever the rich want them to be in order to glean scraps from their table to the dismissal of the poor for even the hint of an offense rather than actually getting to know them and their place to the desperation of people being asked to sub-exist and their eventual reaction, this film stuns by not only displaying the benefits of a life linked to a wealthy person and the happiness that some find there but also watching that happiness turn to despair as time passes.

The humor and joy that is in ""Parasite"" is truly experienced by the audience so that the turn feels true as well when the rug is pulled out. This isn't a horror movie with a dash of humor, or a funny movie with a sprinkle of violent class struggle. It is both, one of the funniest movies I've seen all year and the terror inducing in the same way as the best atmospheric horror that $11.50 at your local cinema can buy.

All of this is interesting but, if done too heavy-handed, feels preachy or propagandist. Luckily, Joon-ho knows how to restrain himself from such blunt force methods as having someone scream something like ""Soylent green is people,"" or ""You maniacs, you blew it up."" (boy did CH ever corner the market on that.) By restraining himself it allows the audience to come to conclusions, ask questions, and discuss amongst themselves without the feeling of manipulation. It respects the audience enough to say, ""I'm not going to tell you how to think but check out this funny, crazy, and fantastic situation and let's hear what YOU think.""

I imagine there are a host of other interesting reading of this film and that is what makes it so fascinating and gives me some degree of comfort when I call this movie more than a movie. It is Art.

Not everyone is into art. I am. If you are too than you should definitely be searching this movie out, supporting it, thinking about it, and discussing it. I know I was thinking about it for days afterward. Weeks now, I guess.","Nov 26, 2019"
8,A fantastic film. See it before the inevitable bad American remake.,"Looks like a few people failed to grasp the films message. It's a more cerebral watch than their intellect can handle. Ha ha.

A dark dramatic black comedy film with a strong social commentary.

Hugely enjoyable and well deserving of its many accolades.

See it now before Hollywood tries to remake it and ruins its excellence. A fabulous director.","Jan 12, 2020"
8,A Korean Masterpiece,"Slow moving at the beginning, but it picked up quickly to a gut-wrenching climax at the end. Comedy of errors, serious social commentary, human emotions and a horrifying climax. All the ingredients of a prize winning film.","Apr 22, 2020"
8,Utterly Original,"Always interesting. Utterly original. At times darkly funny. Plus a biting social commentary.

But at times also uncomfortable viewing. Verging on horror, which I am not keen on. No individual character you can root for.

Clearly, for most the positives far outweigh the negatives. It is easy to see why it garnered so many awards. And to understand why so many viewers are so taken with the film.

But for me the negatives are real enough. Perhaps the biggest problem is that I cannot be on the side of any individual character, so I watched as a somewhat disinterested spectator. That lack of emotional investment also meant that I was unable to shrug off the other negatives.

Yet I cannot mark down too far a film that is so utterly original. That alone makes this worth your time.","Feb 12, 2024"
8,"Man, this movie is way too interesting!","I love the whole movie, including the cinematography as well. It depicts what the director and writers wants to convey. In all aspects, all I can say is I'm very impressed. The beautiful architecture of the house plays a big part in telling the story of the movie too.

This movie also talks about the rich and the poor in Korea. It tells you how different their life could be, and how it affects one's personality. The characters are interesting too. It brings out the mysterious side of the movie. When I finished watching, I can't just say it's a movie of one genre.

You should watch this to understand what I meant. Go go!","Jun 18, 2020"
8,not the best but good enough,Personally prefer 'Burning' but this one offers more dramatic scenes,"Aug 20, 2019"
8,Great but need to cut unnecessary scenes,"A great plot! Fascinating. Should've cut more unnecessary scenes though to get to the pace. I have to skip some prolonged story lines that doesn't add value to the story and characters.

I love each character arc. I love the story. It was awesome.","Aug 30, 2019"
8,Brilliant!,"This movie was immensely fun to watch! My wife and I heard a lot of buzz around this so we decided to give it a watch for ourselves. Acting was a 10/10 with a unique story that was executed 10/10 with fantastic cinematography and directing 10/10. I can't say enough about this movie, it's a MUST WATCH. On a side note going into the movie me and the wife watched the trailer but didn't get much out of it, GOOD! The less you know going into this, the more you will enjoy it!","Apr 16, 2020"
8,Refreshingly different,"Can't say I've ever watched a movie similar to this one. Because of the reviews I gave it two attempts to draw my attention and I'm glad I did. I found it thought provoking with a lingering sadness afterwards, the disparity across humanity. It's a well crafted film with a beating heart and a poignant premise.","Nov 15, 2020"
8,You gotta watch it.,"The only reason I'm giving it a 8 it's because I wouldn't watch it again. Gave me so many emotions, it was a whole rollercoaster. I felt anxious, worried, sad, and even happy at some point. Made me feel fear at so many scenes, it really plays with your mind.

Masterpiece? Yes. Would I watch it again? Heck no.","Jan 17, 2020"
8,The fable and the heavy hand,"When it comes to social satires, directors often push their awareness to the viewers as if they are unaware they are preaching to the choir. Whoever saw Bong Joon Ho's ""Parasite"" will definitely agree with the director's populist political stance. Now only if someone would've told him that as well.

Without spoiling, I can tell you that ""Parasite"" is definitely satisfying. This is a thriller calculated to the nano-meter, equal in precision, pressure, unease and focus. It revolves around Ki-taek and his family--poor, unemployed and living in a ""semi-basement""; some sort of small place halfway underground. Forcing the metaphor, I could argue that is placed symbolically to represent the clear-cut line between the lower and upper classes. They are poor, which forces them to be clever and witty in order to survive. So their plan is to ""attach"" themselves to a rich family.

For the sake of not spoiling, I will stop here. But know that ""Parasite"" touches on every single social point it tries to make. It is a well-defined story of class and the lack of social awareness. This works in the first half of the film, in which the naivete of the rich and the wit of the poor is augmented. This is not done to oversimplify but for the movie to properly present its parable which, by definition, is a ""simple story"". But if this heavy-handed approach pays off, by the end it pushes the characters into unnecessary, inexplicable, sometimes seemingly random explosions of rage.

""Parasite"" is undeniably cutting-edge and modern. Bong Joon Ho uses traditional fables to conceptualize and clarify the vagaries of modernity. Throughout its complexion, it looks decidedly simple as its frames wonder around the minimalist and polished performant Asian architecture of the privileged property where most of the movie takes place--a movie as harsh with its characters as it is with its viewers.","Jan 2, 2020"
8,Great movie..,"But all i could think throughout was, ""you mean to tell me they dont have any security cameras in that house?"" A wealthy protective family just lets strangers tutor their kids behind closed doors in bedrooms? Security camera outside and a secure front door camera but nowhere else. Otherwise a fun, intense ride","Feb 13, 2020"
8,A very unique and fun movie!,"I tried going into this movie with as little information as possible, and I'm glad I did. The title definitely threw me off, thinking that it was a horror of some sort. Turns out it had a lot of comedy and drama. Great characters and very original. I wasn't a huge fan of the way it ended, it felt like a bit more time could have made a difference, but overall I think it deserved a lot of the awards it got.","Feb 24, 2020"
8,Overrated,"It was not bad, but honestly I don't understand how this movie can get a single 10 star review from some people. This movie is simply overrated.","Feb 2, 2020"
8,Not good enough for best picture,"This was a good movie. However, there are plenty of GREAT movies this year. It's ludicrous to put this movie above all other movies. Joker is my favorite movie of the year, but I didn't expect it to win best picture. 1917 deserves it.","Feb 11, 2020"
8,From the same director that gave us Okja and Snowpiercer.,"For an average movie afficionado, I have to admit that while I liked Parasite, aside from the obvious I had to read up about the movie in order to fully appreciate the message it wanted to convey. On the surface, we know what's it about: the story about two families from extreme ends of the social ladder. The Parks with their high-tech mansion and luscious front yard that hides them from the outside world and the Kims with their sub-basement apartment and a window that allows them to look at their sad reality just enough to keep fighting and surviving. What is not obvious though is the why. What transpired in the movie is believable, but the why is what makes the difference. Maybe it's a cultural thing, where here in the Philippines as depicted in soap operas a million times over the Have-Nots are automatically nice people, hopeful that things will get better as long as they keep working hard. Meanwhile the Haves are depicted as calculating and manipulative, taking advantage of those that they can. In Parasite, it's the other way around. And this is very evident when the head of the Kim household commented that the Parks are rich but still nice. To which his wife countered, they are nice because they are rich. That money makes living easy therefore they are not as stressed, that's why they can afford and have the time to be nice. Which is true. I related to when she said that if she had what they had, she'd be kinder too. Of course it's not automatic though and there are always the exception to the rule.

Everyone were well-casted most especially Choi Woo-Shik (Fight for My Way) as the young Kim with whom the chain of events started. I mean I know I'm supposed to hate him but the combination of his cunning and naivete makes him appealing to me and even to the Parks. Cho Yeo-jeong as Mrs. Park was also a standout, playing a balance of a simple yet hands-on head of the household. You may also notice Lee Sun-kyun (The Coffee Prince) as Mr. Park and Park Seo-joon (Fight for My Way/ Secretary Kim) in a supporting role. The last character of note is the the Parks' house itself. It has a personality of it's own, commanding your attention whenever you're within it's premises.

Winning the 2019 Cannes Palm D'or award and besting 20 other foreign films, submitted to be South Korea's entry for Best Foreign film at the Oscars, a 99% Rotten Tomato rating and 8.5 in IMDB, you can not go wrong with this movie. It was well-written, the ""infiltration"" of the host by the parasites flowed naturally. The cinematography was beautiful, charming even in the squalor of the Kims' situation. For all that Parasite tried to do, at the end of the day the world appears the same, but it has definitely changed. For the better or worse, it will all depend on the next set of people assuming the roles of hosts and parasites.","Mar 22, 2020"
8,Good movie but no better than shoplifters,"This film seemed very good in the photographic and scenic part, good characters and a decent plot that is losing its strength at the end where in my case, I get out of the experience of those people by putting a complex and very twisted twist with a style Oriental that for my taste does not work at all. Is it the best of the year? I do not think so, but I do think it is an excellent foreign film with a clear criticism about class conflicts but I like it much more as the movie shoplifters puts it, being more realistic and cruel to the point of making you reflect and depress you for its plot. sorry for my English.","Jan 8, 2020"
8,Amazing Bizarre and Bizarrely Amazing,"In an unnamed South Korean city, a family of four (a middle-aged couple and their adult son and daughter) all struggle with low-paying jobs to get by in the cramped basement apartment in which they live. After the son has the good fortune of getting a well-paying job in the home of a wealthy family, his other family members manipulate their way into similar good fortune. Massive chaos follows.

Among universally acclaimed films, ""Parasite"" is unique: it is actually worthy of its acclaim. It could be described as bizarrely amazing or amazingly bizarre. Maybe both. The first half succeeds as a farcical comedy before going dramatic with many plot twists and turns, suspense, thrills, and a class war to top it off. The film also wins with its flexibility and mystery as to who are the potential villains. And it has a climax that must be among the best of all time.

While most of the dramatic surprises are welcome, some seem unnecessary and over the top (non-spoiler hint: the scene with the aftermath of a huge rainfall); there are also a few false endings. But these pale compared to the film's many assets the best of which is its uniqueness and originality. The cast is great too especially Song Kang-ho as the patriarch of the poor family. His face registers so much pent-up emotion. And director Bong Joon-ho has talents that are comparable to those of Alfred Hitchcock.

It is easy to compare ""Parasite"" with last year's ""Burning"", another South Korean film that digs deeply into modern class conflicts in explosive ways. While these are only two examples, it seems South Korean cinema leads the way in acknowledging contemporary class struggles - a problem that has exacerbated everywhere for the past three decades or so. Hopefully, these fine examples will inspire many more film-makers in all countries.","Dec 7, 2019"
8,Compelling,"Although more a thriller than a true horror, the movie delivered on several levels notably acting, cinematography and direction.

Don't expect too many twists and turns, but this psychological story will certainly mess with your mind in places.

A great movie, easily digested thanks to some nicely voiced and believable dubbing.","Mar 1, 2020"

8,This is great cinema.,"This movie was not at all what I expected, which is great ! I have to say the actress Jeong-eun Lee's performance was freaking awesome !!!!!!! She's the best part in the whole film. I was thoroughly convinced by her performance. Overall, this film is great. I can't comment much on other aspects of the film without spoiling it. The final act is slightly weaker compared to other parts of the film, but still they are all great ! It's best you go to see this film without knowing anything about it. That way you can get a much wilder ride out of it.","Oct 29, 2019"
8,Thoroughly enjoyable,"I'm not a fan of subtitles, so I was a little apprehensive, but knowing it had won an Oscar, I had to give it a go. Half way in, I was gripped.

8,Oscar worthy.,"Parasite (South Korean) review :

A lot has already been said, debated and critiqued about this film which wowed not just the jury at the Cannes but also walked away with four Oscars this year including Best Picture - the first non - English film to do so.

As for my take on it, two scenes stayed with me long after the movie ended : One is the Kim family relaxing in their employers - the Parks- mansion after they go on a picnic. The Parks are unaware that the driver, housekeeper, tutor and translator they hired are all one family - the Kims having cunningly manipulated them to seek employment.

Talking about the scene, Father Kim remarks that their madam is a nice lady. Rich yet Nice. To which his wife corrects him saying She's nice because she's rich.

In yet another amazingly conceived scene, the Park couple is now lying - incidentally on the same drawing room sofa - and Mr Park observes how driver Kim is a well behaved guy who doesn't cross his limit yet he hates his stink. He smells like an old rag!!

In those two scenes, writer director Bong Joon-Ho makes a solid statement on class divide which may not be seemingly apparent but exists and thrives universally at mind set level.

Parasite is a highly relatable drama - blending comedy in to serious situations - culminating in to a cracker of a bloodied climax. Infact, it won't be an exaggeration to say that it explores myriad human relationships like no other film and leaves you wondering at the end who exactly is the parasite here!!

Watch it online on Amazon Prime. The film has English subtitles.

8,Suspense and humor,"Great acting and beautiful camera. Surprising plot turns and very good suspense that oftentimes gets released with a lot of humor. Crazy culmination and somewhat open end, not sure what the story ultimately wants to tell the viewer.","Nov 28, 2019"
8,"Brilliant Class Study, Contrived Plot","Parasite tells the story of the down-and-out Kim family. The son gets an opening with the wealthy Kim family, working as an English tutor. Piece by piece, the other members of the Kim clan scheme their way in such that all four of the Kim family - father as driver, mother as housekeeper, son as tutor, daughter as art teacher/therapist - end up working for the Parks, though the Parks don't know of the relationship between them.

Part (often hilarious) black comedy, part love story, part thriller, all class commentary, Parasite really is a genre-defying film. And, it's genuinely enjoyable. The film highlights the class divisions between the Kim family and the Park family, particularly in the incredible contrasting storm scenes - the Kims have their house upended; the Parks host a backyard camping adventure. What made the film work so well, in my opinion, is that most members of the Kim family do not act as ""good"" people. They lie to get their jobs, they steal from the Park family, and they're willing to frame and undermine the existing help in order to get them fired, even though those people are of the same struggling social class as the Kims. There's no class solidarity here, just doing whatever it takes to get ahead.

I stop at 8/10 though, because I can't get beyond the feeling that the whole basement setup was a contrived device to move along the film and/or unsubtle metaphor. There's a secret underground shelter beneath the house (that the Parks don't know about) and where the housekeeper has been storing her husband for half a decade? The owners never get wind of this, perhaps because they're oblivious to the help who are - quite literally - beneath them. The people living in the bowels of the house feed off the inhabitants up top, like a parasite. And we know that a parasite that goes untreated just might kill its host. Get it?

It's a great film, definitely worth watching. But watching it after hearing all the hype, Parasite just didn't hit me as a 10/10.","Aug 8, 2022"

8,One Parasite you shouldn't avoid,"SYNOPSIS: A poor family in South Korea con their way into the home of the wealthy. They soon find themselves in the middle of a dark, unexpected secret.

REVIEW: This film is truly an original masterpiece. From Bong Joon Ho's direction to all of the phenomenal acting. So intricate and precise it left a really special film. POSITIVES: As I mentioned, the directing is absolutely superb. Bong Joon Ho really has this immersive directing style that get you to lose yourself within the film. You feel as though your living through what the characters are living through. The acting is Oscar worthy all around. Kang-ho Song, Sun-kyun Lee, Yeo-jeong Jo, Woo-sik Choi, So-dam Park and everyone else had unbelievable chemistry together. The big stand outs to me were definitely Kang-ho and Yeo-jeong. I feel those were the two captains of storytelling for their respective families and it was nothing short of amazing. Whether it was the build up for Kim Ki-taek (Kang-ho Song) to what ultimate happens in the end or the absolute unwarranted trust and obliviousness of Park Yeon-kyo (Yeo-jeong Jo). You really get a feel of the difference in class and how a family struggles through poverty in order to make a life for themselves and how the rich use their money to mask their own ignorance. NEGATIVES: Its tough for me to come up with any negatives. This is one of those films where I don't see very much wrong at all, however, it's a film I couldn't see myself rewatching more than twice. Not that it's a bad film or too heavy subject matter, it's just not one of those films I gravitate towards for multiple viewings and that's why I don't have it as a perfect 10/10. CONCLUSION: This is one of those films I definitely encourage everyone to see at least once. It's so original and so well told that I know this is a film people will go back to and talk about the significance this film has on cinema. It will be taught in classes and will be a timeless film. Superb all around from cinematography to editing. This is a great film to get those opposed to foreign films on the boat. 8.9/10.","Feb 10, 2020"

Therefore I'd give it 8/10 if asked. However, this film has been held aloft like Simba by all concerned within the entertainment industry as the 'thing' you need to love and that makes a rebel without a case like me peg my nose.","Feb 18, 2020"
8,Why people should watch foreign films!,"The movie Parasite is one of the many films that reinforce why people should give up this ridiculous thing of not watching foreign films. People are so scared of subtitles that they are missing out on some of the best films ever made. After 5 minutes of subtitles you get used to it and don't even realise you're reading.

Anyway back to this movie. Parasite is a fantastic film that really has no set genre as you will experience a drama, thriller, romance and horror all in one! Unlike most films you actually can sympathise with 99% of the characters even if they are seen as more of a villain. I wont give anything away but I will say that Parasite is a must watch and one of the best movies of 2019!","Jan 12, 2020"
8,"unpredictable, eerie and with original horror plot","Nowadays, the horror movies seem to be just about blood, gores, and fear-inducing trite. Parasite is breaking the mold in this category as well as in the realm of Hollywood. The synopsis won't be needed as you need to see it for yourself, and for your own good. The fact that Hollywood has already adapted its plot and is currently in the works with the help of its director proves its ingenuity.","Jan 18, 2020"
8,Worthy oscar winner,"I loved this: it only came out in the UK this weekend and I needed to see it before the oscar winners were announced. The use of colour, space and sound is superb. The actors are perfect and it's just wonderfully funny and thrilling at the same time. I found it a little slow to get into but it was worth the effort: the poor of society are so often treated as like cockroaches; a different species, parasitic, work shy, undeserving. And, as one of the characters points out, if we were wealthy how much easier would it be for us to be kind and generous people? The wealthy here are not evil, simply oblivious.","Feb 11, 2020"
8,An Interesting watch,"To be honest, I didn't know where this film was headed halfway through but I must say I was surprised in the best way. The mix of genres the underlying tones of survival of the fittest and class was outstanding. A must watch.","Feb 12, 2021"
8,You know is Korean movie when something like this happen.,"From my exposure to Korean Drama/Horror I know that something at some point will go horribly wrong and the end there is no happy end for nobody. And yet this was so unexpected when I watch this movie. Great drama, 8/10.","Jan 16, 2020"

8,One of the best 2019 films,"Usually I don't like movies, where i have to read subtitles, because movie is in foreign language, but in this case - i have to say - all in this movie was perfect - actors, directors work, writers...in these 2hours and 12 minutes i was excited to see how the movie will end up. And I'm glad to say and knew, that this is Oscar winning movie. Bong Joon Ho have to make a lot of new movies to our next generation.","Feb 19, 2020"
8,Another bong masterpiece,"Thought provoking, self reflective, socio economic critique. Highly entertaining film that mixes genre styles or tropes giving a wholesome movie watching experience. The agony of poverty and class inferiority is the raging theme of Parasite. At first, knowing the title of the film and the directors previous films i thought this was going to be a ""Apocalyptic virus outbreak"" kind of film, But it turns out a metaphor for the plot of the story - A poor family finds a rich family and slowly becomes a part of their house and their life and in the end the parasite does what a parasite does.","Aug 8, 2019"

8,Excellent Movie - Finish Rushed,"This is obviously an excellent movie - great acting and directing and production and photography with excellent dialouge and a tight script. It seemed to me that the ending was 'rushed' and it was far too predictable. But this movie has some great moments that will go down as movie moments for a long time - no spoilers. I have seen the other academy award nominees, and although this movie was excellent - I think that Once Upon a Time was better. Joker and Irishman are both more a series of scenes around one actor - but Parasite is a movie where there is no single dominant actor as such. The lead role is Kim the father, but in many contexts it is also about the son, daughter and mother - the parasites.","Feb 15, 2020"
8,PARASITE,"This was a throughly engrossing film. Certainly something all movie lovers should seek out and see. Funny, Nuanced, Suspenseful, and poignant. It really has something to say and the performances are all just great. This is why we go to the movies","Nov 9, 2019"

8,"A clever, very modern tragicomedy.","I'm not sure I would have seen this film without my wife's prodding, and it's partly because of the title. It's accurate enough to the storyline but as an English word it's a bit creepy in tone. I think it needed a somewhat different translation from the original Korean. But on to the film itself: obviously it's a labor of love for Bong Joon Ho, who's the writer, director, and producer. I didn't know any of the actors beforehand but they are all just fine, and they do a great job at making each one have distinct personalities among a fairly big cast of speaking roles. I also like that in our theater we got subtitles rather than some clumsy dubbing. (and the subtitles are the best and most accurate I've seen in recent times.)

For lack of a better term I would describe this as a tragicomedy. A slum-dwelling family of four in an unnamed Korean city live by their wits on odd jobs. Through a series clever little twists they find a way to gradually insinuate themselves into jobs as servants to a young rich suburbanite family who never suspect what they're getting. (The young family are indeed rich enough to pay a whole coterie of servants including a driver, tutor, housekeeper, and nanny, but they're not uber-rich like the Crazy Rich Asians -- they actually do work hard and have their own issues. Not knowing any better, I'll take it for granted that their ultra-modern Western-style home and garden are realistic depictions of that class.) For about the first half of the movie this plotline is played for a good deal of humor. But then through another series of twists this house of cards comes down and things go sideways , leading to a rather shocking final scene. Quite a lot hinges on the maybe-improbable presence of a hidden underground bunker and a key character introduced very late in the story (no spoilers). There turns out to be more than one ""parasite"" at work, and it's more than just the young rich folks who don't know what they are getting into.

It's a complex, multilayered story (2:12 run time) and the director throws quite a lot at us. But there are no wasted or unnecessary scenes. A prominent example is during a freak torrential rainstorm. The rich folks (on the high ground, as we notice for the first time) just sit inside their beautiful garden, while the poor slum dwellers cannot save their pathetic basement flat from being washed away (complete with raw sewage in the streets). It's excruciating to watch, and this is where the message hits home. Basically decent people are forced into doing things they shouldn't do by their own circumstances and there is in the end nothing they can do to escape. The message that class determines destiny was quite a bit more overt in Bong's previous effort Snowpiercer, but it's present here too throughout.

At the end, everyone is left damaged, but we're given a wistful little coda that holds out just a tiny ray of hope. That's only human.","Dec 18, 2019"
8,Highly effective blend of genres,"I can't remember watching a film that covers as many genres as 'Parasite' (Gisaengchung) and does it so successfully. This is a highly entertaining film that starts off as a comedy/drama and gets darker as it goes along, becoming a rather sinister mystery thriller with some highly effective horror elements. Most films that try to cover multiple themes end up messy but 'Parasite' never felt in danger of that.

At a time when the film industry seems to be increasingly short of original ideas, something as fresh as 'Parasite' is always welcome. The comedy genre in particular just seems to be made up of the same recycled jokes - this film is funny while being completely different to anything else out there at the moment and that alone is quite an achievement. 'Parasite' is great, highly recommended for those growing tired of the usual stale Hollywood productions.","Nov 9, 2019"
8,"Interesting storyline, great acting and plots","I am really impressed with the way Mr.Bong has portrayed the characters' characteristics. He showed how much time and effort he had put into the process of making this film. However, there is one thing that I cannot stand to not wonder. How come a notable family like that cannot afford a single decent camera inside the house? Is it that easy to break into that such private and top-notch accommodation? Besides that I have no comments on either the storyline, the BGM (which are flawless), the light, the settings, the acting. Everything is great.","Apr 12, 2020"
8,Quirky,"Not your run of the mill movie this, twists and turns but its almost always watchable. Recommended.","Mar 8, 2020"
8,Parasite really is the kind of remarkable experience,"Parasite really is the kind of remarkable experience that makes modern movie-going/Binge-watching such a joy. South Korean filmmaker Bong Joon-ho already has an impeccable track record, but he's stepped up his game with this brilliant, powerfully revealing social satire.

The film had its world premiere at the 2019 Cannes Film Festival on 21 May. It was released in South Korea on 30 May 2019.

Described by its creator as ""a comedy without clowns, a tragedy without villains"", Parasite is more Shakespearean than Hitchockian - a tale of two families from opposite ends of the socioeconomic spectrum, told with the trademark genre-fluidity that has seen Bong's back catalogue slip seamlessly from murder mystery, via monster movie, to dystopian future-fantasy and beyond. We first meet the Kim family, headed by father Ki-taek (Song Kang-ho) and mother Chung-sook (Chang Hyae-jin), in their lowly semi-basement home, hunting for stray wifi coverage and leaving their windows open to benefit from bug-killing street fumigation. They have nothing but one another and a shared sense of hard-scrabble entrepreneurism. So when son Ki-woo (Choi Woo-shik) is faced with an unexpected opportunity to home-tutor a rich schoolgirl, he gets his gifted artist sister, Ki-jung (Park So-dam), to forge a college certificate, bluffing his way into the job and into the home of the Park family. An architectural wonder perched high above the slums of Seoul, with views not of urinating drunks but of luxurious lawns and starlit skies, this wealthy house is everything the Kims' pokey dwelling is not: elegant, angular and weirdly isolated. While aloof businessman Mr Park (Lee Sun-kyun) is at work, his anxious, uptight wife, Yeon-kyo (Cho Yeo-jeong), tends to their coquettish daughter and hyperactive young son. It's a lifestyle that relies upon hired help: tutors, a chauffeur and, most importantly, a devoted housekeeper Moon-gwang (Lee Jung-eun), who stayed with the building after its original architect owner moved out. Spying an opening, Ki-woo (newly dubbed ""Kevin"") realises that his own family could easily fill such roles, and hatches a plan that will inveigle the Kims into the privileged lives and home of the Parks.

He Kim family may live in sewage-flooded squalor, but they are clearly every bit as smart as, and a lot more united than, the Parks, who turn their noses up at the smell of ""people who ride the subway"". Similarly, while the smug Mr Park is habitually depicted ascending the stairs of his ultra-modern home, and the Kims are pictured scampering down city steps to their own underworld apartment, it's clear who holds the dramatic high ground.","Oct 24, 2024"

8,Impressive,"I got way much more then I actually expected. I was confused, impressed, entertained at the same time. I loved the way movie described the huge distance between rich and poor,as they were 2 different species. It is really rare you come across to a movie which is way more unrealistic and yet again able to describe the reality as it is.","Sep 15, 2020"

8,"Loved it, So many twists and turns...","This movie covers all aspects you'd like for a film. It goes from a comedy with important subjects to feel-good, to waiting-that-something-really-bad-is-about-to-happen to a lot of other emotions.

I can't even compare this film to another. It's one of a kind in so many ways. Not your usual type that is. Completely deserves all won awards.

And to think I just stumbled upon this masterpiece. Everyone needs to see this one! The story is about the Kim family who try to get by in any way they can and I don't want to spoil anything because you're in for a treat. Everything that can happen basically happens and at the same time, the viewer is exposed to the differences of class in society,

Watch it!","Jan 4, 2021"
8,New standard of Asian irony-comedy,"Dear movie freaks, watching this Koran movie does not make you die hard Korean fans, so take it easy. This movie becomes popular in my country because the news telling that this movie had won Cannes Palme d'Or 2018. For the very first of the scene, it took us on the daily live of lower class in Korean big city, how they survive, how they are growing up, and how money comes to them. Then the audience will surprise with the originality of the story and will never know the ending. The movie has not plot twist, but still will make you close your eyes in some scenes. I believe all the actors here are very talented theater players, because the words, expressions, and how they interpret the story are so natural, then also will make you laugh in some serious scenes. The title ""Parasite"" will be understandable if you also concentrate on what the core idea of the Director wants to deliver, about being a family, a partner in crime, group of friends, etc. Even people clap their hands at the ending of the scene. Now my curiosity have been pay off and still I am wondering this movie could be new standard of Asian irony-comedy. Irony because of the originality of idea and comedy because audience can still laugh while Director put them in some critical scenes. Palme d'Or could be a very good step for Director career and also Korean film industry. So congratulation.","Jun 28, 2019"

8,Nothing Short of Great Work,"2 years after its debut in 2019 and I'm just now getting around to watching Parasite. Where to start... when people talk about creating art that drags you in and doesn't let go, this is what they're speaking of. The level of suspense throughout the whole film while showing hints of genre after genre after genre really makes this a class act. With numerous twists and turns, this movie is a professional jaw dropper. To you who is about to take part in this experience, congratulations!","Jun 29, 2021"
8,Great film,"This story shows how possible is making a low cost film with great results. It is simple, but the trama is original. Well, not so original but very well directed. This film represents the low-income people of Korea, as any other country has its social problems, and let us know how far people can go when facing hard times.","Jun 28, 2020"
8,A good movie but not Bong's best work,"An interesting movie with complex social hierarchies portrayed without the classic tropes.

Overall a very solid movie, but my personal take is this was the worst of Bong's movies.","Jul 16, 2022"
8,Must watch:,"English is my first language and I'm always hesitant to watch foreign films because of the subtitles. It's challenging and sometimes an effort when I want to relax and watch a movie. I'm so glad I made this choice to watch the Parasite. The film is original and very well shot. I loved the actors and by the midway point I forgot I was reading subtitles, the film pulls you in to its world. Fantastic film and I will check out more of the directors work.","Jan 6, 2020"
8,"Money is so kind, and money can iron everything","1.General review South Korea has been leading for 30 years on the road to pursuing art and resonating with the audience. The traditional view is that literary films are films that are more reflective of profound thoughts, but they also mean a good and tangible experience. Commercial films are just the opposite. Nowadays, the Korean film industry has already had a work that combines depth and perception. At this time, Chinese movies are still drifting away in the mud of money.

2.The appearance of breakthrough represents more mature thinking The film depicts mainly class differences and divisions. But the most core breakthrough is the opposite of good and evil. In the traditional film of the reaction to the class, the rich are always portrayed as rich and poor, and the poor are always diligent and kind. The film is the opposite. The rich man is a hard-working woman who has a family and his children are not awkward; the poor are savage and sneaky. The reconciliation of this character image shows that the film's creative thinking is more mature, and it is no longer necessary to deliberately highlight the theme through class opposition. And through more realistic role positioning, with the plot, to communicate with the audience.

3.Understatement and into the wood This film is used to distinguish the class, the most important thing is the smell. You don't need a luxury shoe bag, you don't need to travel Shopping, just such a label that has been neglected and yet vivid, has become a finishing touch. What is the smell of living in a dark and damp basement for a long time? The film gives a more appropriate description, ""cooking the taste of the rag"". This distinction does not help the audience not applaud. The whole film did not deliberately render the hardships and hardships of the poor. It's just the smell, with the long ladder in the rainstorm, the sewage filled in the basement, it seems to be understated but it is three times. As a negative example, you can compare the ""Taste of Money"" (2012), I believe that everyone will be able to feel the shackles of spilling the screen, how boring.

4.Calm, is the biggest gap After completing the division of the two classes by smell, how to show the gap between the two classes? The director gave a unique answer: calm. When the male master stood at the window and looked at the hilarious party on the grass outside the window, he could not help but tell the difference between the two classes: calmly. The version of the poor is given from the father's mouth: ""People should not have plans, and they will not go wrong without planning."" This kind of contrast is not obvious when you look at it, but when you are fine, you understand the difference in attitudes between life and the scorpio between the two classes.

5.Performance, icing on the cake The performance of the two actors of the father and mother in the film can be said to be the icing on the cake. Song Kangxi In the basement and driving, the deliberate expression of self-esteem can make the audience feel the inferiority of the inner character of the wrapped person, and thus can end the anger and stab the president. This is the anger of the little man who was dismissed. In particular, the one that turned back after the president of the thorny center was full of confusion, confusion, and helplessness. Zhang Huizhen's mother, when she was drinking in the rainy night, had a very wonderful performance. The expression was in a few seconds from scare to anger to fear of the last laugh, and every trembling of the face muscles was a play.

6.Not perfect, there are also disadvantages The whole plot is divided into three sections. The plots with some fine details can be trimmed in the middle, and the main line is not helpful. In addition, I don't really like the end of the film. Father escaped from reality and how do you know when to pass information? Reuniting the sun seems to be a reflection of the darkness of reality, but the actual painting is superfluous.

7.Written at the end There is a stone in the play that symbolizes the flow of class, which was eventually discarded by his son. For the contemporary society, poverty is the only disease. Stone is not an antidote.","Aug 18, 2019"
8,An incredible movie with one of the best plot twist ever realized,"I was very hyped about this movie since the trailer was released. I did not know what to expect. The story is brilliant and I never once felt bored, the more I was going on with the movie, the more I was intrigued by it, and I wanted to know what would happen in the next scene. Character development is amazing: every character has his own personality, they have their own psychological profile, and you can immediately bound with them, because they look humans.

Kim, a young boy part of a poor and unprivileged family, one day receive a job offer from his friend, to work as a private English tutor for the daughter of a rich korean family. The guy, that starts to earn a lot of money, will then involves his family, in order to earn even more money and be without debts. The entire family manage will work for them. In order to obtain that, they will use illegal strategies. These strategies are so well conceived by the movie, that even me felt tricked at a certain point.

The cast did an amazing job by being so expressive, a good performance that for sure helped to win the so earned Palme D'Or to Cannes Festival. Parasite is a movie that will put you on front a of different moral dilemmas and sometimes, you don't really know which side to take.

For sure one of the best movies of the year. Make yourself a favor and watch it is really worth it.","Jan 2, 2020"
8,Bong Joon-ho's drama/thriller/comedy is definitely worth seeing,"It's hard to nail down what type of movie Parasite is, but this drama/thriller/comedy is definitely worth seeing. Bong Joon-ho tells this story in a way that keeps you engaged and keeps you guessing, with protagonists you can't fully like and antagonists you don't really hate. Even though I may not agree with every decision this film makes, I enjoyed the journey and I'll be thinking about it for a very long time.","Jan 31, 2020"
8,a masterpiece,"Parasite, a masterclass in storytelling and social commentary, is a cinematic gem that deserves its place among the best. Its strengths are plentiful, from its razor-sharp acting, particularly the standout performances by Song Kang-ho and the ensemble cast, to its impeccable cinematography that seamlessly blends humor and tension. The film's hauntingly captivating score and visually stunning scenes add depth to its narrative. While it may have a few moments that could be perceived as slow, Parasite's brilliance lies in its exploration of class divide and human nature, making it a thought-provoking and utterly compelling cinematic experience that merits its 8/10 rating.","Sep 19, 2023"
8,It has almost everything you want in a great film,"Where to begin?

Well the first thing which comes to mind is that Parasite is a fantastic movie in almost every aspect, I said almost in the description as well and that is simply because there is a small number of details that someone who has kids can find a little out of hand, without crashing you the film I'd say that not even this kind of parents would allow the kids drinking like crazy, particularly if I'm not mistaken in a kind of family culture like they have in this country.

That said, the story is extremely intelligent and well written brutally funny at times quite violent and direct too and when this things happen, they do for a reason and perfectly integrated in the story.

Cinematography is excellent, Direction and casting fantastic and the cast performances are top notch, the two starring families describing perfectly their ways of life and how the interaction between them and the social aspects of that are paramount in how the story develops until the very end.

As I said, a film that will leave you speechless many times and will make you have a sensational time.

Believe if I ask you to ignore the low rates and give this film a chance, I can guarantee that you won't regret it.

It's like a day in Ireland, you have the 4 seasons in a few hours. Here you go from feel sad to laugh your lungs off in a mattrer of minutes. Easy to understand the Palm D'Or in Cannes Festival. SUPERB.","Jul 9, 2024"
8,A perfectly cromulent film,"The obvious question, which might not have an obvious answer, is who or what is or are the parasites in Parasite? Maybe it is easier to determine who or what is or are the hosts? The first hour plays as though Adam Sandler had directed a Korean version of Upstairs, Downstairs, a tale about the poor serving, or parasitically suckling upon, the rich, separated vertically so those on high do not, or even cannot, observe the filth of the lower classes as they struggle to acquire the most basic necessities, such as a good and free wi-fi signal.

The second hour plays as though Sam Peckinpah had directed a Korean version of Upstairs, Downstairs, a tale about desperate times and desperate measures, uncertainty about belonging, and a lesson about the fleetingness of a good situation. The mood of Parasite runs somewhat tangentially to that of A Serious Man, a slightly anarcho-nihilistic tone that despite anyone's good or bad intentions, or even lack of intent entirely, there is a dark hole tugging at the back of our brains whispering sweet somethings of impending, unavoidable, and utterly passionless doom.

Given this background, one might argue that there is no message, no meaning to a movie like Parasite. At the least, it is an investigation into whether a host or parasite can change its behavior for the better or for the worse.","Nov 27, 2019"
8,masterpiece,"I'll just come out and say it. Parasite is a masterpiece.

A bonkers, beautiful, radical, and drop-dead intelligent dark satirical tale of social inequality and the mock egalitarian weirdness of late capitalism. Parasite is a master class in storytelling, providing one of the finest examples of how to entertain the masses while still telling a deep and meaningful story. The film feels too insincere and hypocritical to take genuinely seriously on its theme of social injustice.","Mar 4, 2022"
8,Crime & Class,"An impoverished family finds ways to worm themselves into a wealthy household, until an unexpected turn of events throws their plans into disorder.

_________

Parasite is the best Korean film I've seen for quite awhile, though it's not without its flaws. Even allowing for poor translation, a good deal of the dialogue is weak and hard to follow, several plot threads are introduced that don't go anywhere or end up being satisfactorily explained, and too many elements (the morse code, for instance) stretch credulity and feel crowbarred in because they are necessary for the story the makers want to tell, rather than making any sense *within* that story.

But for all that, Parasite reminds me of everything that is so great and different about Korean cinema: a twisted, amoral, mischevious inventiveness, interspersing thoroughly leftfield turns with out-of-nowhere snatches of shocking and perfectly choreographed violence that make you involuntarily laugh out loud in both horror and admiration (in this instance, at a kick down some stairs). I honestly never saw the twist in this one coming at all, and it's a doozy, taking the film in an entirely different direction to what I'd been expecting.

Though not as great as its accompanying hype is saying, Parasite is still one of the most original and enjoyable films this year and definitely worth a look.","Dec 1, 2019"
8,Oscars!,"I liked the film, to see a Korean film gain recognition is a breath of fresh air, South Korea is mainly known for its K-dramas not for niche films like this.

Korean movies are making me obsessed with fantasy..","Aug 11, 2019"
8,Simply amazing!,I herd good things about this movie but I never expected I would love it so much. It was brilliant. Reminds me of another brilliant movie I just saw JoJo Rabbit. Like JoJo Rabbit that movie's dark humor gets you swept in before hitting you with just pure darkness (although you get a better shining light with Parasite) It's a well done picture. I'm taken away by what a good story about social status is was. Recommend highly,"Oct 22, 2019"
8,it was ehhh,"The ideal way to experience South Korean auteur Bong Joon-ho's award-garlanded, international box-office smash Parasite is with as little prior knowledge as possible. The film is a remarkable experience that makes modern movie-going such a joy, and the author saw it for the fourth time last week and is now eager to view the black-and-white version that Bong recently unveiled at the Rotterdam film festival. Parasite is a tale of two families from opposite ends of the socioeconomic spectrum, told with the trademark genre-fluidity that has seen Bong's back catalogue slip seamlessly from murder mystery, via monster movie, to dystopian future-fantasy and beyond. The Kim family, headed by father Ki-taek (Song Kang-ho) and mother Chung-sook (Chang Hyae-jin), have nothing but one another and a shared sense of hard-scrabble entrepreneurism. When son Ki-woo (Choi Woo-shik) is faced with an unexpected opportunity to home-tutor a rich schoolgirl, he gets his gifted artist sister, Ki-jung (Park So-dam), to forge a college certificate, bluffing his way into the job and into the home of the Park family. Ki-woo (newly dubbed ""Kevin"") is a wealthy businessman who lives in a luxurious house above the slums of Seoul. His wife, Yeon-kyo (Cho Yeo-jeong), tends to their coquettish daughter and hyperactive young son. Mr Park (Lee Sun-kyun) is at work, while his wife, Yeon-kyo (Cho Yeo-jeong), tends to their coquettish daughter and hyperactive young son. Mr Park relies on hired help such as tutors, a chauffeur and, most importantly, a devoted housekeeper Moon-gwang (Lee Jung-eun). Ki-woo discovers that his own family could easily fill these roles and hatches a plan to inveigle the Kims into the privileged lives and home of the Parks. Parasite is a melancholy ghost story disguised by generic mutations. It is a tragicomic masterclass that will get under your skin and eat away at your cinematic soul. It is played by a flawless ensemble cast who hit every note and harmonic resonance of Bong and Han Jin-won's multitonal script.","Jun 5, 2023"
8,Interesting,"I watched this film last night, just before the night when it woukd win 3 oscars. I can understand why it did win, though personally I can not say that I was blown away by it.

8,A cordial invitation to welcome this Parasite gem in the 21st century full of remakes and reboots.,"Following the step of Get Out, it is a powerful film that comprises of metaphors and allegories which need you to think beyond a certain level as they are manifested throughout. No worries, you will understand the film even if you fail to unlock the codes unlike Mother! & Us.

Parasite welcomes the audience into multi-genres and tonal shifts that mix and take its turn after every act. Pure comedy, dark comedy to heavy dramas, horror, thriller, mystery, you name it. The director, Bong Joon-Ho wonderfully converts them smoothly without letting the audience feels bizarre of the transformation.

With merely 10 characters into play, Parasite brilliantly executes layer after layer of interesting character developments which progresses the plot forward to ultimately produce a comprehensive film.

Parasite professionally handles cinematic tricks to synchronize every possible element for the greater good such as excellent use of cinematography techniques with superb artistic values, information-packed dialogues, lavish architecture production designs & vibrant colours.

Quite certain scenes feel a little too long and weary. If they can cut short and add new scenes instead, the pacing will be better and more entertaining.

Majestic musical set pieces is utilized in the background to help produce a richer tone to the distinct elements.

The suspenseful moments would have you at the edge of your seat without noticing until the point you recall your experience inside the hall.

Verdict: A strongly crafted masterpiece film on social themes and satire that finds its place in audience's heart.

In short, it is one of those episodes of Black Mirror.","Aug 9, 2019"
8,Very interesting plot!,"Great! Awesome! Very interesting plot! I think it is one of the best thriller of 2019! I'm not a fan of Korean films, but this is great movie! I hope it win one or few Oscars!","Jan 14, 2020"
8,Well... what should I say?,"... what should I say about Parasite? This film is a real gem.

The directing is just great, coupled with by an impeccable cinematography. The writing is entertaining and give the characters personality and layer, as well as the story. The themes are justified: the difference between well rich and poor family is one of them. The characters personality are reinforced by the great acting performances of the ensemble cast.

Everything in this movie is a gem. Evrything.

Bong Joon-ho, you are maybe one of my best filmmaker.

Parasite rating: 85/100","Nov 15, 2019"
8,Not bad,"Good movie. Not my type of movie, but it's good. I only looked at him because he's in a good reputation.","Apr 26, 2020"
8,Modern day parable,"This film starts out like a comedy but gets pretty dark. I can definitely see Bong's signature style that we can also see in Snowpiercer, especially the social satire. Both of the families in this film have their own issues that really come out. The main point is the overall setting, portrayed visually through the architecture. Everyone is trapped by the class system and cannot escape except by ruthlessly attacking each other for what amounts to not much in the end.","Jul 8, 2020"
8,"A good, relatable, and easy-to-access South Korean film, much like ""City of God"" was for Brazil.","Just saw Parasite for the first time with subtitles. For a foreign film from Korea, this is very accessible for all languages and audiences. The actors are all expressive, attractive, and do a really good job acting. The story has lots of universal, contemporary components to it of pop culture.

For what it's worth, the best way to describe this movie would be by calling it something like South Korea's ""City of God"", or something along those lines; what you have here is an impressive foreign film that is stylishly directed, well-written, and pretty gritty.

It starts out as a fun and enjoyable dark comedy, which slowly dwindles down during the second half when it becomes part thriller, part mystery (without giving away spoilers).

I wanted to give this movie the full 10 rating, but unfortunately I just could not. Sorry, but I had to question the ease at which the events unfolded, and that's not to say that it wasn't fun and perhaps it had to be that way to make the movie work, but there was slightly just enough questions to take it out of the ""perfect"" range of storytelling. The same issue also arose in the second, back half of the movie- some of the events that unfolded towards the end also raised some questions which cause it to not be a perfect 10.

However, other than these two (fairly big- big enough to deduct two points) flaws, the script is practically perfect, especially for a foreign film. The writers and director did a nice job of developing the story and added just enough layers to captivate, immerse, and challenge your mind, while also keeping it entertaining. They added just enough style to differentiate it and make it stand out as something thoughtful and creatively made.

I was hoping this would win me over for a Best Picture Oscar upset contender, but unfortunately, it just didn't quite prove enough to me to have confidence in that possibility. It could still happen, but after viewing it with an open mind, it looks like it's between Once Upon a Time in Hollywood and 1917.

EDIT: Slept on it and decided I would still pick this over 1917 because at least it had a script with some meat.","Feb 9, 2020"
8,"Original, Unconventional but Overrated!","To follow the trailer, I was not interested, but then the movie held itself high in IMDb trends. Thus I decided to watch it. The movie is South Korean and one needed subtitles to understand it. Sadly this was too much and I gave up after ten minutes of run time. I would like to add the names of people with mentioned country and neighborhood are quite confusing and it takes effort which is escalated even more if you are to understand it with subtitles.

A day came when I decided to again give it a try. The reason being Oscars this time. The movie won four Oscars. After searching for hindi version I settled for youtube narration for one fifth of time. What did I conclude was is everything associated was good enough but then still it was overrated. Once again my belief of awards being overrated stood concrete.

Final Verdict: The story is not something good on the senses neither in the category all's well that ends well. However it presents side(s) worth knowing. I would like to see it in a language I am more comfortable with in future.","Feb 26, 2020"
8,artistically a great movie - emotionally more disturbing than I needed,"Had I watched this movie before squid games, i would have most likely rated it a 10/10. Unfortunately I watched it after, and that takes away much of the novelty that went into squid games because there are so many parallels. Also, personally, a bit sickened from this style of drama. Artistically, however, it is a an excellent movie, with great performances which, coupled with great directing, it feels you are watching a theatrical performance from fist row seat!","Apr 11, 2022"
8,A good film but....,"I did enjoy this film, but it didn't strike me as a worthy Oscar winner.","Mar 25, 2021"
8,A brilliant movie!,"If you want to see why this move took the Oscars, you should check it and give it a try. Maybe you would like or not. Just watch it!

Yes, the metacritic score it's really high for this movie. But yeah, it's a ""must see"" movie. The soundtrack used in this movie is fantastic!

The acting was great, from my point of view.

If want to see a drama movie with a little few scenes of comedy, a ""dark comedy"" you should try it. Trust me, you won't lose anything.","Feb 10, 2020"
8,8/10,"I get it now. I understand the hype. This movie is tremendous. Its clever, intentional, and gripping throughout. Every line. Every set piece, every shot is on purpose. It works so deliberately toward its goal without being predictable. Its so absolutely tense, and crescendos in satisfactory fashion.

A deep study on class and its implications in society as a whole. It asks questions like what does class hierarchy do to those who suffer from it? The story centers on people who are on the margins of society and are (forced?) to make some unseemly decisions. Who do you root for? And why?

This movie WILL stand the test of time.","Apr 13, 2020"
8,oddly unique and great movie,"This kind of interrogation might still feel as effective in a gloomier, more self-serious film, but Bong has somehow mastered the art of mining powerful messages in the midst of hair-raisingly entertaining set pieces, breathtaking action sequences, and daffy character development. The balance he strikes between the grave sincerity of his subject matter and the agile levity and stimulating smarts of his filmmaking gifts regularly reveals a deeply spiritual artist, one who wants audiences to pay attention, but who also knows that getting audiences to transform often requires age-old stories to be told in freshly affecting ways.

Parasite burrows far deeper than most films dealing with economic disparity. Its sheer weirdness and wit undergird a profound meditation on the rancid decay at the core of a society that turns up its nose at the stench of truth. It invites exploration of what lies beneath the politely accepted status quos of wealth and poverty with the force of an inevitable revolution. Like the striving family at its center, Parasite is not to be underestimated and will never be forgotten.","Mar 6, 2023"
8,Great plot,"Great movie, great screenplay, fantastic twist, I just hoped it was more balanced, sometimes things happen too fast and sometimes to slow","Feb 12, 2020"
8,"A versatile, metamorphic thrillride","Parasite seizes our expectations, breaks them down, builds them up, and knocks them down once more. This Korean masterclass assumes no clear genre, refusing to pigeonhole its ambition. Straddling the line between comedy, thriller, and horror, the production presents the conceptual 'parasite' as the underlying motif; it's a profound, tragic social commentary on classism as much as it is a satirical, sardonic throwaway remark on a parasite and its host. Decorated with multidimensional metaphors, signs and symbols, it would be criminal to not have a second or even third viewing to fully soak up Bong Joo-ho's flavoursome visual poetry.

Should you laugh or cry? Take sides, or simply observe the events unfold? In taking no clear stance does this movie most thrive. In stirring and string-pulling every capacity of human emotion while dodging the clichés does it tantalise the audience like few other productions have.

While slow in places, and with an occasional plothole, this was overall a gorgeously shot, satisfyingly unpredictable slice of thoughtful motion picture entertainment; presenting a particularly dark blend of black comedy.

8.4/10","Feb 17, 2020"
8,Superbly Gripping & Entertaining!,"This movie is about perfection in all aspects of its execution. I did not blink at all the whole time. Jeez, even my first two sentences of review sound like it's an action-packed thriller. But this movie makes itself everything, from satire to horror. Great!","Aug 27, 2019"
8,Revolutionary movie which everyone must watch,"Parasite is already an International sensation now, the four oscars are icing on the cake.I used to watch dubbed versions too, but from last 3-4 years i am watching movies only in Original language and with subtitles.I will suggest everyone to do the same, avoid dubbed version and watch in original language with subtitles (Intitially it can be tough to read but you will catch up soon).As director Boong Joon Ho famously said ""Once you overcome the 1-inch-tall barrier of subtitles, you will be introduced to so many more amazing films,"" Talking about the film, Parasite is kind of a revolutionary film.The first half seems like a smart con movie, but 2nd half is a big surprise. It talks about class division, discrimination on poor. It talks about limits the poor can go to live a better life and earn some money. Boong Joon-Ho's direction is flawless, the story is relevant to international level.I liked it very much.Asian movies needs more recognition Internationally","Feb 20, 2020"
8,Intricate storytelling,"The manner which the story is being told here, combined with some very intriguing characters, make this one of the best movies of the year. A lot about this film is very well done, from the acting to the shot composition. I also love the social commentary undertones. The ending is a bit unnecessarily violent, but overall this is a very good movie I would say.","Nov 30, 2019"
8,"South Korean movie is original, witty and storytelling at its very best","""Parasite"" (2019 release from South Korea; 132 min.) brings the story of the Kim family. As the movie opens, we get to know the family: they live in a semi-basement apartment, and mom and dad are out of work, and their teenage son and daughter aren't in much better shape. Then one day, the son's friend Min informs him that he is leaving the country, and that it would be good if the son takes over for him as the private English tutor of a HS sophomore girl, whose family is well-off, if not rich. The son agrees, and before we know it he is now the English tutor... At this point we are 10 min. into the movie but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: this is the latest film from Korean writer-director Bong Joon-ho, best known for his 2013 ""Snowpiercer"" film. Here he brings a one-of-a-kind story that is so plot-heavy that I cannot take any risks in spoiling anything, so my comments will be brief. Let me say this: there is a good reason that ""Parasite"" won the top prize (Palme d'or) at this year's Cannes film festival, and I will already go on record that there is zero chance that this movie isn't getting an Oscar nomination early next year for Best Foreign Language movie. The movie is everything that Hollywood at its worst (with endless sequels, prequels, franchises and ""re-imaginations"") isn't: It's original, it's witty, and it's storytelling at its very best.

""Parasite"" got a limited release in New York and LA in early October, and has gradually been rolling out to more cities. The movie opened this weekend at my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati. Man, I couldn't wait to see this! The Friday late afternoon screening where I saw this at was attended okay but not great (10 people), but I am quite certain that as word of mouth gets around, this will find its box office legs in the weeks to come. If you are in the mood for a top=notch foreign movie that is original and witty and will have you on the edge of your seat, I'd readily suggest you run, don't walk, to check this out, be it at the theater, on Amazon Instant Video, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion.","Nov 2, 2019"
8,Redoubtable,"An interesting movie with a unusual concept and a great finael. Has a good balance betweem european and asian style, but i think it was long a bit. A good movie, but I don't understand this hype, and the enviable place in the top 250","Jan 17, 2020"
8,So over-rated but it has a good storyline.,"One of the most over-rated movie of last years. Rated as 30th best movie of all time? It can be in 150 but no more. Not that realistic (not because its comedy style, because it has wrong parts), detailed and effective storyline. It has wrong parts that could not happen, the nonsense parts I mean. I also watched Memories Of Murder, not so different than this movie, but Parasite is so over-rated. Over-rated on websites and Academy Awards. I don't know how can be this movie the first Best Picture winner with foreign language. I know the Best Picture awards are not quite very well chosen. But we have seen amazing tens of movies from Italy, Spain, Turkey, Japan, Germany but none of them won the Best Picture in 100 years and this one won? Not that amazing and the other nominations was not that bad. Academy Awards only well chosen on Actor and Actress awards.","Sep 17, 2020"
8,"Disturbingly funny, unexpected and original","This is a class distinction based story full of allegory and plot twists. It's a drama, comedy, mystery all at once.

It may be the coloring of the movie.","Feb 2, 2020"

8,Hollywood vs Netflix,"Don't get me wrong. Parasite is a great movie. This being said, I believe that Hollywood is saying we'd rather vote for a subtitled foreign film than recognize Netflix as a major player. The Irishman, The Two Popes and Marriage Story are also great films and deserves more recognition.","Feb 10, 2020"
8,you'll enjoy this,"Surprise surprise, they have poor people in South Korea too!

Every news story from South Korea carried by our Western Media shows glittering highrises , gleaming, if crowded, cities and fabulous transportation systems.

Everyone is slim and good looking, everyone has a great job in the electronics industry and it's capitalism at its best, or so they would have us believe.

Underneath this glamour is the same societal structure as there is in the West.... fabulously rich people and the wretched poor.

The story, and we've seen it many times before, is that the wretched poor want to even things up by stealing from, or conning, the rich. It's just human nature at work.

If only the socialists studied that same human nature, instead of being angry at the rich, they would be able to come up with workable solutions to the injustice, but I digress, let's move back to the job at hand.

With the backdrop of South Korea as our tableau we get into a pretty good plot with the underclass pulling a scam on a rich but naive family.

The scammer protagonists, Mother, Father, Sister, Brother, are living in squalor in a slum, with no real hope of getting out, when they have a stroke of luck by scoring an introduction to a wealthy family.

They use their devious talents to infiltrate the family and before you know it they have all been hired by them to look after their domestic needs, with well paid, luxury jobs.

From there on in we have the wonderful juxtaposition of the wealthy family living a Kardashian type lifestyle (only much more refined) against the ""we've hit the jackpot"" mentality of the slum dwellers.

Of course there's no ""off"" switch for scammers and the beauty of this film is the way they manage the story as it spirals out of control.......... it is really well done.

The acting is superb and the mise en scène is just fabulous. The pacing is right on the button and it's no wonder the film attracted so much attention.

Even with the subtitles it is a very absorbing movie and although I wouldn't put it in the ""classic"" category (as I would with ""A Separation"") it's one I could easily watch again and enjoy it just as much.

I have no doubt that it must have been the best picture from the choices that the Academy had.

It's head and shoulders above ""The Irishman"" and head and shoulders above any other Hollywood movie I watched this past year.

Well worth watching!","Mar 8, 2020"
8,Very good satire,"One of the best scenarios in recent years. Very smart, full of symbolism and links. The first half of the film was perfect for me, as they infiltrated, a funny and rounded story. The quality drops a bit in the second half of the film when the genre and tone change. The very end of the film was also not the end to the end and when it ended I had no sense of delight. I think it is a great satire and a critical society, the division between the layers exists and is quite pronounced today, it is not possible to move from one layer to another, there is a big difference between them. It is said with us: A full does not believe a hungry man.","Jan 3, 2021"

Once you think you have it figured out, it throws you a curveball and goes down a completely different road.","Mar 11, 2022"
8,Not a masterpiece but brilliant nevertheless,I didnt get carried away it was a brilliantly crafted film showing the haves as a bit dense and the have not far more clever but because they had to be. It had brilliant twists and turns and deserves all the accolades. But best film. No. Films that should get best film are those you should visit a cinema for get the whole experience. Parasite will be remarkable on DVD which some films lose that cinematic experience that's why I don't rate it as 10 but that's me and I respect those that think otherwise.,"Feb 13, 2020"

8,"Great Movie, Deserved The Oscar Win","I just got out of my second viewing of Parasite. I first seen it back in November at an advanced screening.

I think anyone watching this after the Oscars will probably think it is over rated (I certainly think that about Gladiator and Silence Of The Lambs) and 1917 should have won. I'm not one of them, I loved 1917, but I loved this equally as much, and I was totally fine with it winning. If movies with subtitles bother you, this will not be for you.

For me thought, it is 100% original, you'll never know where it is going, the acting is great by all concerned and it is darkly funny.

I have to say, It was a lot more effective on its first watch, as I knew nothing about the movie (which is how I think it should be seen) and it simply blew me away. That has now been taken away now, but it is still a great movie.","Feb 14, 2020"
8,Discreet Deception,"It's got attention through a Hollywood Event though it is a good film, quite cleverly done. It's quite violent ending takes you by surprise too. It's not worthy of 5 wins of course but not many people know what Korean films have to offer.

8,"Best Movie of the Nominees for the Year, but Not Perfect","This won BP because it was the best overall movie based on all of the nominees. It had good: acting, directing, original screenplay, score, and cinematography.

All of the other nominees were good in only one or two categories, maybe three. But this movie checked all the boxes.

If you only wanted acting, you see Joker or Irishman; if you only wanted visuals and cinematography, then you see 1917; if all you wanted was acting and set design, then you see Once Upon a Time; if all you wanted was actresses, then you see Marriage Story, Bombshell, or Judy.

But if you want the whole package, then this was the best movie of the nine nominees as a whole, and that's why it won. When voters vote, the ultimate winner is also decided by how many 2nd place votes a movie gets, so the winner will gets lots of 2nd place votes in addition to the 1s, and that's finally why it won.","Feb 11, 2020"

8,"Good, but not Oscar material","What we have here is 2 movies in one. The first half of the movie seems to be an Ocean's Eleven style long con. That was the part I liked, it was very fun and not overly preachy. Then it goes full blown drama about class wars, ending in tragedy.

I wouldn't have had a problem with the movie if the tone had kept consistent, if I wasn't being set up for a Rian Johnson style ""subvert your expectations"". Also the portrayal of class differences is taken to ridiculous levels here, it's just not realistic. ""Oh look, feel bad about these people because the rich people literally wrinkle their noses at how they smell"".

Definitely not better than Joker, but then Slumdog Millionaire won the Oscar instead of Dark Knight in 2008, so what do you expect?

All in all it's a solid, good, well acted 2 movies you're getting. The first one is unfinished.","Feb 20, 2020"
8,Excellent film...avoid reading anything before watching!,"Went in with high expectations and was not disappointed in the least. Didn't know much about the movie prior which is the best way to go into this. The film takes you for a ride with moments of comedy, terror, suspense and everything in between. Very well done and solid acting all the way around except for the ""simple"" wife which I didn't care too much about.","Sep 14, 2020"
8,Slightly overrated but genuinely very good,"From Okja and Snowpiercer director Bong Joon-ho comes Best Picture Oscar winner Parasite, a South Korean dark comedy about a poor family lying their way into working for a rich family in order to improve their bleak living conditions.

The film focuses on the Kims, who live in a small basement apartment and are desperate for a better life. When they're not studying or doing the odd poorly paid and thankless job like packing pizza boxes, they try to cut corners by attempting to use their neighbors' wifi or getting rid of cockroaches by letting in anti-pest fumes through their window when the pest control guy patrols the alleyway above, where drunks often go to throw up. Through a contact, Ki-woo (Choi Woo-shik), the son, is given the temporary opportunity to take over tutoring the daughter of the well-off Park family. This opens the Kims up to using this idea of trusted contacts in order to infiltrate the Park household by each doing a different job for them. They pretend to be virtual strangers, sabotage the people already working for the Parks and everything goes according to plan... until it doesn't.

Much has been said about the themes explored in Parasite and, indeed, you don't see this poor/rich dynamic done in such a bold way very often. Recent release Knives Out attempted something along the same lines but Parasite never sugarcoats the Kims, which could have come off as condescending and often does whenever, incidentally, an Oscar-nominated film tries to reach out to minorities or people below the middle class. Green Book, for example, probably had its heart in the right place but its dated execution left many cold. The Kims may be the victims of a society that turns everyone into parasites but so are the Parks: Bong Joon-ho wisely avoids the ""poor people are inherently good"" and ""rich people are inherently bad"" dichotomy, instead taking aim at the system as a whole to show how it dehumanizes people in different ways, breeding resentment, desperation, even violence between them.

Of course, there is a power imbalance here as well with the Parks having all of it throughout, by virtue of their wealth, despite the Kims' best attempts at leveling things somewhat so the Kims were doomed from the start. This dynamic, along with a shocking twist halfway through, leads to some nail-biting conflicts within the Parks' swanky house and it reaches a boiling point by the end.

This is a carefully crafted film with slick cinematography, clever (if sometimes a bit too on-the-nose) motifs and excellent performances so its popularity at award shows was deserved, though one has to wonder why movies from all over the world are only recognized by the Academy once in a blue moon. South Korean directors like Kim Ki-duk, Park Chan-wook and many others have plenty of masterpieces under their belt but they have been largely ignored by most bigger award shows. The good news is that Parasite's big wins could be the start of the Academy finally looking past its own Oscar bait and selecting more arthouse fare from all over to celebrate. Then again, the Oscars being what they are, it might also be a one-off nod, which would be a shame but not all that surprising.

Parasite is a funny, sometimes shocking, often very good film that never goes quite how you expect it to go. The ending might be its weakest element as it feels a bit too spontaneous when it had been so darn tight up until that point but it still works well enough. This is definitely one of 2019's best and it's well worth checking out but I encourage you to seek out a lot more South Korean films as well, whether Hollywood promotes them or not.

Very good.","Nov 7, 2023"
8,it is right time to give Bong a shot in his already robust arm,"Two years in a roll, films from Far East have snatched the coveted Palme d'or, after Hirokazu Koreeda's SHOPLIFTERS (2018), here comes this year's champ, Bong Joon-ho's PARASITE, his 7th feature, also first Korean film to be crowned the top honor in Cannes, which denotes Bong's almost inconceivable triumph in conquering both cinema's box-office and artistic fronts, a feat even Steven Spielberg cannot achieve in his salad days, Bong can indeed have his cake and eat it as well!

Both SHOPLIFTERS and PARASITE hinge around the underclass, but a more apposite reference of the latter should be Lee Chang-dong's BURNING (2018), a Cannes also-ran, both Lee and Bong vigorously tackle the ubiquitous classism, the pathological canker in our modern society, while Lee deliberately and stylishly veils his central story with elusiveness and makes great play of the ambivalent mystique exuded from the unattainable pursuance of truth, here, Bong cunningly employs gripping genre tropes to underpin his trenchant perspicacity on the treacherous waters of rich and poor's co-existence.

In Seoul, the semi-basement dwelling Kim family - patriarch Ki-taek (Song), his wife Chung-sook (Jang), their two adolescent children, son Ki-woo (Choi) and daughter Ki-jung (Park So-dam), slyly insinuates their way into being employed by the high-flying Park family, respectively, as their driver, housekeeper, English tutor and art teacher. Sparks fly and laughter erupts intermittently in the beggar-belief process of how each member of Kim family tactfully excels in their designated jobs and consecutively sells on the unsuspecting....

8,Could have been drag more and more until an unexpected ending,"Slow burn, gripping, tension and feeling uneasy while watching. Best performance by Kim, his father Mr. Park and their family. And the other family mother is also. And everyone in this movie did their best in acting. This story can be dragged more and more. Than we could watch a better ending. I think, here the makers should have to do more research about the ending. Otherwise a solid screenplay and story.

It's all about class difference or class inequality. It's all about greed. It's all about karma - Tit for tat.","Nov 1, 2019"
8,"Great movie, great acting which plays out excellently.","I wasn't quite sure where this movie was going at first but like with all good movies, this one puts this caper into place with precision. The only criticism I would give is that it plays out quite slowly. In fact, there are some areas that I felt could have been cut from the movie to save a little time but not detract from how the story is told.

I won't go into too much detail about the movie as I don't want to spoil anything. All I will say is that this movie is really enjoyable, has good humour and sorrow but overall, it plays out brilliantly and it is certainly understandable why it won an oscar for best picture and best screenplay, to name a couple.","May 25, 2020"

8,The Overrated-ness is getting to me,"Not gonna lie, the Overrated-ness of Parasite is starting to get to me. When I first saw it at the cinema I was very impressed, but after some thought I think it's probably closer to an 8 objectively. The last 30 minutes in particular drag it down somewhat. Not really a huge fan of the direction it takes. I simply don't get what on God's Green Earth made this one of the highest rated movies of all-time on some websites and listings. It's pretty baffling and far from being a flawless movie. That being said, I still like it. The Black and White Version added nothing to it though. If anything it made it pretentious for absolutely no reason.

7.5/10.","May 7, 2021"
8,great movie! Final could be better,"The film was being a masterpiece, to some extent .... the ending was disappointing. But I really liked it!","Mar 24, 2020"
8,"You name a genre, this movie covers it","I can't remember the last time I saw a movie that contained as many genres as 'Parasite'. The movie starts out almost like an 'Ocean's Eleven' heist film and then expands into a comedy, mystery, thriller, drama, romance, crime and even horror film. It really did have everything and it was strikingly good at all of them too.

I love a film that respects its audience. There are so many details in this movie that are crucially important and yet the film trusts its audience to notice them and acknowledge them without ramming them down our throats. There are a lot of layers to this film and I suspect for this reason its rewatch-ability factor will be very high.

The film was incredibly entertaining too. I can't think of a boring scene in this movie and yet on the surface for large parts of the film you would say not a lot is happening, at least in terms of action. Fascinating characters and brilliant dialogue are what create this. I had a great time with 'Parasite' and I think most that give it a chance will too.","Oct 6, 2019"
8,Masterclass film,"Parasite is a film that brings together a plethora of genres that all coalesce effectively. But this is truly a story that has many layers and the shifting tones create an atmosphere that is both eerily terrifying as well as holistically captivating. If you like movies with social commentary, this one is for you. It is so good, With pitch perfect performances from the entire cast and the smartest script of the year.

It is a very strong contrast after 40 minutes of the story, to see the father of the family on the same scene , trying to save everything he has from his flooded house, while on the next scene, he has to pretend that everything is fine.

So when the later half begins we begin to wrestle with thoughts like the morality of the rich and poor families. Are the rich really evil do ignoring the poor? Does the poor have the right to fool and steal from them?

Finally, I think the description of all characters wants to show nobody is right or wrong. It's just the situations that makes us react the way we do.","Feb 3, 2020"
8,Bong's Brilliance,"When it comes to foreign films I tend to be a little biased or lenient. They are such a welcome break from traditional Hollywood. When I see a decent foreign film I can't help but want to praise it more because they don't have the multi-billion dollar Hollywood machine behind them. Usually, they have to be more creative, more ingenious, and more resourceful.

""Parasite"" is one of very few Korean films I've watched in my life. My foreign film bank consists mostly of Chinese kung-fu movies of which Jackie Chan and Jet Li probably occupy the most space. Korean films are a rarity for me. This suspenseful thriller by Bong Joon-Ho deserves all of the accolades it has received.

What I knew about it going in was that a poor family had moved in on a wealthy family to take advantage of them. That is essentially what happened, but you're not holding anyone's attention with that concept alone. Each character in this film had something to offer and was watchable. As the movie developed and we saw the Kim family sinking its teeth deeper into the Park family, we were treated with wonderful dialogue and a crafty script.

How do you make a movie in which none of the characters are antagonists and none are really protagonists either? Some how ""Parasite"" did that. The Kim family certainly was shady and underhanded, but they could be viewed as a poor family just trying to get ahead. The Park family was wealthy, yet unlike your average rich movie family, they were not cruel or unbearable people. In fact they were very likeable.

Normally, we want our clear-cut good guys and bad guys. We want our good guys to win and our bad guys to lose. In the cases where all of our guys are good, we want them all to win. In the cases where all our guys are bad, we want them all to lose. In ""Parasite"" not everyone is distinctly good or bad and there are really no winners.","Jan 22, 2020"
8,Unique movie experience,"Cinematography is very good.

Excellent acting by all lead actors.

Perfect mix of art and commercial, this is how movie should be made. It entertained audience as well as received many major awards.","May 28, 2020"
8,A brilliant and emotional film that slowly grows in you.,"I saw the movie Parasite quite blindly, I hadn't seen the trailer and had barely read the synopsis, but I knew that the director and cast couldn't disappoint me, and the interesting cover attracted my attention to see the movie.

And I made no mistake. Parasite is a quite particular and diverse work, which is responsible for building a story original and charismatic, attractive and yet slightly disturbing, but in a way that leaves us a strong emotion at the end of seeing it. With a fairly solid and interesting start, the film takes a complete turn in half and becomes even more entertaining and fascinating than it seems at first, showing a quality good enough to attract my attention, the unexpected.

However, it's not just the interesting plot, but the provocative narrative and beautiful cinematography that builds the characters in a deep and realistic way. Creating palpable characters full of mistakes and at the same time humanity. Finishing with a strong and emotional escapeist ending, a unique film that is sweetly welcomed into the small collection of original and fantastic 21st century films.

PS: Korean cinema never ceases to amaze, how great.","Nov 27, 2019"
8,Boon Joon Ho is a genius,"I have seen this movie 5-6 times now and have shown it to 4 of my friends. This movie is a masterpiece. Acting, Directon, Story, Screenplay, Cinematography everything is top notch. This director's work is amazing and I cannot wait for his next film. Just watch it!","Jul 9, 2021"
8,Unbelievable...,"""Parasite"" is a Drama - Thriller movie in which we watch a struggling family doing everything it can in order to succeed. Since they are all unemployed they don't have anything to lose and they risk everything. After an opportunity that shows up they find themselves not only interested but a part of the wealthy and glamorous Parks. But everything changes when they get entangled in an unexpected incident which they couldn't even think of it.

I enjoyed this movie because it was very unexpected and full of surprises. It had a lot of suspense and many surprising moments. Regarding the interpretations, Kang-ho Song who played as Kim Ki-taek was simply outstanding, Yeo-jeong Jo who played as Park Yeon-kyo was equally good and Woo-sik Choi who played as Kim Ki-woo made a very good interpretation. The direction which was made by Bong Joon Ho is simply amazing and in addition to a very interesting script makes this movie not only interesting but something very different and unique.

Finally, I have to say that ""Parasite"" is a surprisingly great movie to watch with a very good direction, a well-written script and many good interpretations made by its cast. I recommend everyone to watch this movie because I am sure that you are going to enjoy it and if you haven't read any critics or reviews for this movie yet I am sure that you are going to enjoy it even more.","Nov 22, 2019"
8,"Orderly artisanship, but no wow! for me...","Yes, the script is equal to the task, there are several twists (but also predictable moments), performances are pleasant (Song Kang-ho as Kim and Cho Yeo-jeong as Choi), but apparently my expectations were too high after lots of awards and accolades. The title is ambiguous, and the course of events is as the Coen brothers would join forces with Tarantino...

The film in question won 4 Academy Awards and it is nice, but if I look back on The King´s Speech, Rain Man, or No Country for Old Men - also with 4 Oscars, then I have to admit I liked those more. My bad... :)","Feb 14, 2020"
8,Deep Movie,"To be frank on my first watch I didn't feel much great about the movie... But then I read, watched some videos and now I enjoy the movie very much... It's an artistic beauty...

8,Clever,Never watched anything quite like it. The story was awesome. I really enjoyed it. The ending was a little confusing. Maybe I missed something. I didn't understand why the father flipped out. Still thought it was a witty clever movie. Check it out.,"Nov 28, 2019"
8,Basement Of Deceit,"You won't see many unique takes on class disparity as given in 'Parasite'. We start with a family living in a slum basement apartment who, through a tutoring opportunity given to the son, successively infiltrate the home of a wealthy family in the capacity of personal servants. They manage to do this through deception and subterfuge against the family's current help staff.

It's easy to see the parasitical nature of this impoverished family yet the wealthy family isn't able to perform normal daily tasks without the help of others implying that they're parasites of the lower classes since their lives would fall apart without them.

The story unfolds in a very unique way starting as something of a comedy and becoming progressively darker with several key plot twists that were an enjoyable surprise. There were serious logical flaws with the ending of the film; it wasn't a believable ending but the overall story was very engaging and interesting.

There was a very distinct visual style to the film, partly created out of necessity of the story. The use of levels of buildings and staircases helps create a visually engaging film and aids in the telling of the story in important ways. You also have a sharp contrast in visual spaces between the impoverished family and wealthy family's apartments with both the spatial dimension and the windows. The basement apartment is cramped with low a ceiling and dirty window people urinate in front of while the wealthy home was custom designed by a famous architect, has wide open spaces and a large wall window looking out at well lit private yard.

What stood out most about this film was the initial set up creating an expectation of a moralistic tale about class struggle that gets shattered fairly quickly and by the end is completely non-existent. There was no moral lesson being preached and instead we're given a raw look at human nature.","Apr 21, 2023"
8,"A good movie, but not Oscar worthy","If you consider the Oscar as a prize for movie making quality and not a political sham, then Parasite did not really deserve the highest praise. However, it was a good movie. Everyone acted really well and the underlying social commentary that is so common in Boon Joon Ho's movies was very strong while telling the story of a family of poor people who scam their way into the employ of a rich family and start leeching of it. The divide between the rich and arrogant upper class and the very poor is made obvious by this dark movie with occasional comedic undertones.

Bottom line: movies about poor people scheming to get money fast are too common in Romanian cinematography. Probably that is why this movie didn't really impress me too much. It is a good movie and very well made, but the story was just... meh.","Feb 13, 2020"
8,I remunerate that's an original script. That much Oscars? Doubtful,"Bong Joon Ho had done a great job. One of the most original international script and his directing was brilliant. The plexal events leads the scipt to a wonderful inevitable ending that would both expected and harshly expected by the audience. I can't say much about acting since I don't know Korean but the story slowly swallowed me up. Mostly with the raising the complexity of the plex of the plot as I mentioned. Personally, I have of course no doubt about its originality and uniqueness, however I still think that maybe the best international film award would go to Almadovar's Pain and Glory as Parasite was declared as the Best Picture of the year.","Mar 27, 2020"
8,No one does it quite like Joon-ho Bong! [+84%],"It's safe to say the Joon-ho Bong is one of the greatest original storytellers of our generation. The man's filmography speaks for itself. Barking Dogs Never Bite, Memories of Murder, The Host, Mother, Snowpiercer, Okja, and now, Parasite - that's the kind of portfolio to be proud of. Now let's talk about the movie in question here.

Parasite is a darkly funny social satire that paints a subtle (yet not-so-subtle) picture of different social strata. On one hand, we have Kim Ki-taek (the brilliant Song Kang-ho), an out-of-work driver who lives in a dingy apartment with his wife Choong Sook (a mighty effective Jang Hye-jin) and his two college-age kids Ki-woo and Ki-jyeong. On the other, we have the well-off family of Mr Park that comprises of himself, his wife Yeon-Kyo, and his two children Da-Hye and Da-song.

A series of events leads to Kim ki-woo getting employed by the Park family as Da-Hye's tutor. Then, we come across the master-plan executed by Kim Ki-woo to get each one in his family employed by the Parks. This stretch of street-smarts versus rich-naivety while engaging and funny, still seemed like it was missing the 'element of twist' commonly associated with Bong's films. But what awaits you beyond the first hour is utterly inventive. It's indeed twists-and-thrills galore, with performances by every single cast member rising to the occasion.

Parasite, as a film, should claim a rightful genre to itself. It's a masterful blend of so many genres: comedy, family, drama (plenty of it), survival thriller, satire, horror (rarely), and many more. The social inequality trope isn't used for stirring extra sentiment. Instead, Bong cleverly plays around the concept and shows how intelligent film-makers can tell a story revolving around every section of the society without pandering to either. Most of all, Bong's attention to detail is impeccable and this pays off in several scenes.

The film boasts several scenes (not moments, scenes altogether) that are worthy of further discussion. The subtext is impressively underplayed, with the second hour leaving no stone unturned. The climax is the best thing about Parasite (as is the case with most of Bong's movies) and it makes a giant statement - both in terms of storytelling and as a cinematic finale. Parasite is the kind of film that needs multiple viewings; a second or a third viewing will reveal even greater context about each of the meticulously-created characters. Also, two thumbs up for the production design and cinematography departments for making everything in the film appear so very real.

Verdict: This time around, the 'monsters' are human, and they're more than fierce! A MUST-WATCH!","Aug 15, 2019"
8,Korean Gem Among This Year's Film Collection,"Being an Asian myself, it feels great to see Asian films win the Palme d'Or for two consecutive years. Parasite has a quite unique style and tempo in telling its story. Most spectators, while watching the first half of the film, might well mistake it for a comedy that depicts life of a bunch of jobless social dregs. Well, the plot took some drastic turns when the parasite family lodged happily in the mansion of their employer. The second half is full of vehement conflicts, as if the masks that helped hide the impassable gap between their classes has suddenly disappeared. The stench felt by the couple is all too metaphoric. Educated and civilized as they are, the couple still could not withhold the disdain they held for the lower class in the social hierarchy. Clash of different identities finally turned into a catastrophe. Impoverished people, despite trying every means they are able to get hold of, be it wily tricks or honest labor, will always feel out of place up high on the social ladder. Maybe drinking beers in the damp and dark corner will be a happier ending than to spend life in disguise and despair.","Sep 3, 2019"

Its not that i didnt care but there were many ideas and subversive elements going on underneath all the drama i felt that it ultimately pulled in too many directions at once to be a masterpiece.,"Oct 9, 2020"
8,Excellent Screenplay!,"The movie ""Parasite"" has one of the best screenplay in the history of cinema. Director and author Bong Joon Ho transcends with a story that is super original, smart, witty, and capable of holding the audience until the end of the film. Bong Joon Ho jokes and discusses the disparities between rich and poor through a family that uses every subterfuge and trickery to be part of a higher layer of society. But once infiltrated, they realize that they are still considered second-class, even for the aroma they emanate. A great cast that enhances even further the strong plot. This is a novie not to be missed.","Mar 17, 2023"
8,Unique and full of surprises! 8/10,"Review: Were do I start with this film! I really didn't know what to expect because every time I asked someone what it was about, no one could explain it, and now that I've watched it, I can totally understand why. I deliberately waited for the UK Steelbook release because I was hoping that it would come with an English dubbed version, which it didn't so I wasn't happy when I saw I had to read subtitles all the way through. I can honestly say, it wouldn't have worked with a dubbed version because of there expressions and tones. Now, after the first 15 minutes, I didn't know where the movie was going, and I personally thought that the rock was going to have some mystical and magical powers, but it's SO cleverly written and full of surprises throughout, and I'm glad that I didn't know what was going to happen. The acting is top class, and with the storyline being based around 2 families, in two houses, it proves that you don't need a massive budget to produce something special. A lot of people think that 1971 deserved the Oscar for best picture, but after watching this film it beats it hands down for its originality, acting and pure suspense. The amazing twists and turns, mixed with comedy and emotion, was put together extremely well, and you couldn't help but feel for the family who used their brains to get out of the gutter. There are little touches of genius, like the smell aspect of the storyline, and the way that the dad could turn on a switch of a button, which all come's together by the end of the film. Anyway, I fully recommend this movie to all moviegoers, except for kids of course, and I hope that people will give it a chance because you will be surprised with the outcome. Brilliant!

Round-Up: This movie was directed by Bong Joon Ho, who also brought you Barking Dogs Never Bite in 2000, Memories of Murder, The Host, Tokyo!, Mother, Snowpiercer and Okja. The only movie that I have seen from his previous work, was Snowpiercer, which I wasn't that impressed with, but this film was unique and a touch of class. It's not often that I agree with the Oscar's panel, but in this case, I did. It won 4 awards, including Best Picture, Best International Film, Best Writing and Best Directing at the 2019 Awards Ceremony, and it's the first Non-English film to win an Oscar in the Best Picture category. Truly Deserved! It covers all genres, which is extremely rare, and the message about different classes is relevant to what is happening around the world today.

8,8.5 average is a little too high,"I likes this movie, I don't believe it did anything wrong but it{s also not better than many other films that are 8+ on IMDB, I thin it just got a little overhyped there hasn't been that many great films in recent memory. I would put this one on the same level as ""Knives Out"" or for example, a great film all around, entertaining, thought provoking, funny, easily digestible and memorable, but even with all those positives, I would not say its better than, for some examples, The Departed, Whiplash, Casablanca, Good Will Hunting. Lawrence of Arabia, Wolf of Wallstreet, even Three Billboards etc. Although to be fair there are many films with an 8+ average that should not be as high as they are either like Joker, and even som 7's that deserve to be 8+ like Tenet, it was just a little hard to grasp everything with 1 view and no subtitles, or Babylon, which was crazy, but it was also beautiful in it's own way.

Anyway I am getting a little off the rails but the point is that when I saw it as number 36 in IMDBs top 250 it feels unfair for many other films that may be a littler harder to digest for the average person, but have a lot more substance. Is it a good film? Yes it is a great film, definitely recommended for just about anyone, but is it top 40 of all time? No, perhaps top 40 of it's decade at best but as someone who has watched a lot of films, I seriously doubt it would even be top 100, maybe top 150.","Aug 14, 2023"
8,Very Good Movie. But Not A Great One,"Much less, not a Hitchcockian one. Perfect performance of all actors, specially Yeo-jeong Jo (the rich mother) and So-dam Park (the smart sister of the poor family). The movie is a perfect mix of black comedy with a little suspense. But it's not a thriller. Perfect contrast between the rich family and the poor one. The cinematography is perfect when it shows this contrast during the storm. After I watched the movie, one question remains to me: who was the real parasite in the movie?","Jun 2, 2020"
8,A jaw-dropping satire on Class Divide,"Parasite is a moving essay on the class divide.

A beautiful shot movie that takes you through the struggles of a downtrodden Kim family trying to meet ends. For them, everyday is a battle for survival.

During these struggles, they come across the Park Family.. Initially you meet the naive wife, who can't pick on any lies. She gives access to one of the Kim. And one after another the Kim's systematically encroach all household activities of Park household.. Ofcourse Lies, forgery and greed are the themes running in the background...but mostly this movie is a sharp satire on Class divide..

There are a lot of surprise elements in this movie and it does catch you off-guard. Especially, when the old caretaker (who btw has been removed by the Kim's through careful planning) , requests to enter the house for a very hideous purpose.

The architecture of the house itself is beautiful. The stairs are used to good effects. Director conveys a lot through the different stairs and windows in this little tale.. also no tiny detail in this movie is there by chance, it is there for a purpose.. which is what makes this movie even more interesting... It is like an artwork, which on surface might just be telling one story but inside... It holds a lot... So it is basically, on the viewer, what he/she makes of it.

Wonderful watch.

P.S - As an indian watching a Korean movie, the language is tad distracting but still with subtitles, it is a comfortable watch.","Jun 30, 2020"

8,Keeps you interested,"This movie paints a picture of necessity. One family needs to survive, another to to thrive, and when the tempo clash, there will be casualties on both sides. Life goes on for both families, but it shows that the less fortunate are more prone to violence.","Feb 2, 2020"
8,Good Enough,"There is a big hype about this movie, and for a good reason. Unlike those popular films that those days create a buzz because of the action plot and the big names, Parasite is more about the social message that it wants to pass through than a likable story that will appear to the masses.

So, overall, Parasite is good. If you like movies about real people, that are not afraid to show the raw reality and social injustice, than watch this one. It is a roller coaster of emotions, with lighter, more comical moments and more thrilling, suspenceful moments. And the film combines them masterfully and everything works well together. The performances were top notch as well. The story, finally, was well paced and interesting.","Oct 31, 2019"
8,"Inventive, original and well acted","What is it with foreign movies! they just seem to be able to pull a new idea out of the bag and deliver it with aplomb and this social commentary of Korea and the world in general is no exception. Different culture, different ideas and way of life perhaps but this movie applies equally to West as it does East and pulls out all the stops to deliver an excellent nights viewing!

Very well acted and produced, this just goes to show that there are a shed load of new ideas out there if one is just willing to look for them.","Sep 5, 2019"
8,A very different film that keeps on surprising,"I did like the film, somethingswere not suprisikg but just when you thought that you had the movie figured out it throws something else at you. It had a slow start but the tension really builds up towards the end. Eight concrete houses out of ten!","Jan 30, 2022"
8,"Over-rated, but an Entertaining Black Comedy !","Parasite is a fine example of Korean cinema and an entertaining, cross-generic piece with overt Hitchcock influences, but the best film of 2019 and the best screenplay? Well, I'm sorry I don't think so. Not by a long way.

It's very professionally made and the main themes of class conflict, social inequality and wealth disparity are hard to miss. But that's the thing; for a film that's won an Oscar for best screenplay, there's precious little subtlety or nuance on show. Mrs Park is simply depicted as an air-headed social matriarch, with Mr Park, who's supposedly had the brains and initiative to start up a successful multi-national company, not much better.

The Kims on the other all seem exceedingly bright, sharp as tacks, in spite of their living conditions which can only be described as basement third world in a first world economy. I'm not doubting the existence of the banjiha, but seeing the Kims continually lob up to work, so fashionably and immaculately dressed in clean pressed clothes and so intelligently well-spoken hardly rings true. This is before and after their abode (and presumably their wardrobes) have been entirely flooded with sewage.

For me, all the best storylines generally have more distinctive shading of characters and behaviours; not the absolute stark contrasts between the haves and have nots, on display in Parasite. And I need to emphasise here that I'm talking about intelligences too, not just material possessions and finances.

A film such as 1917 dazzled me in places, to the extent, that I was wondering ""how they managed to do such and such a sequence?"" I was entertained by Parasite, but never enthralled, by what many critics were and are still saying is a ""near-perfect"" picture. I can't agree with this sort of summation. Having said that, I must confess to having a leaning towards seeing the black and white edit, that is supposedly going to be on offer later this year. I am intrigued to see whether a look at that might alter my perspective somewhat.","Mar 6, 2020"
8,It's good but not all ends are closed,"It is great. The comedy element is working across the movie, there are many unexpected resolutions of situations but in the end I find it containing too many unresolved moments / elements which might have some additional interesting spins.

8,Parasite is nail-biting and intense thriller that is going to give you goose bumps,"The Oscar fever has started and it is my favourite time of the year where I get to watch the films which is engaging, clap-worthy, entertaining and relatable. Parasite was already in buzz for sometime which caught my attention and to my surprise turned out to better than expected after seeing it.

Parasite tells the story of differences in the mindset between the Upper class and Lower class families which is very much existing in our society. As the name of the film itself, the movie gives a detailed account of how an unemployed family is influenced by the lifestyle of a wealthy rich family and eventually enters into their house only to get the shock of their life.

Directed by Bong Joon Ho, who made Snowpiercer and Okja, Parasite boast off characters which you can easily relate to. A poverty driven family comprising of a struggling father, Kim, and mother, tech savvy son and a careless sister - who goes the wrong path to enter the house of a rich family but ultimately face the consequences. The film slowly and eventually picks up as each member from the poor family starts getting the job in the house of rich, by falsely accusing the old staffs. The main drama unfolds when the rich guys go for a vacation and the Kim's family take over the house and celebrate their win. However, they meet with an unfortunate incident when one of the old staff comes back which changes their plan completely. This is where the film kicks-off when the rich guys cut short their trip and plan to come back which leads to series of uninvited events, leading to more excitement and thrills you never expected.

If you go the wrong way, you have to face the consequence and that is what the director Bong Joon Ho showed in his film when Kim's loses one of his family member and ultimately face the redemption. Hats of to Bong Joon Ho for creating a beautiful drama with relatable characters, humorous situations and a powerful storyline with a strong message. There are couple of scenes which is executed brilliantly - when two staff families meet at the basement, the flood scene depicting the behavior of Kim's family - Kim picking up in stuff, son grabbing his favourite stone and daughter lighting her cigeratte even though the house is in mess. The beauty of cinema lies in the story-telling and this is where Parasite scores.

Technically, Parasite has a wonderful background score with lovely cinematography. Editing is superb, though I felt few scenes could have been trimmed. Art direction is brilliant while dialogues are outstanding. Performances wise - I felt all the actors played their part while but if I had to pick up, my favourite would be Kang-ho Song, who plays the role of father of the unemployed family.

Parasite is nail-biting and intense thriller that is going to give you goose bumps. Brilliant 4/5","Jan 11, 2020"
8,"Wow, just wow!","'Parasite' can be summarized in a single word: WOW!

Director Joon-ho Bong brought us the incredible films 'Memories of Murder', 'The Host', 'Mother', 'Snowpiercer' and 'Okja', and now 'Parasite'. Starting out as a comedy, the film soon reveals itself for what it truly is. This brilliant script has an ingenious set-up, morphing into a full-on, devious thriller.

Initially innocent, the antagonist family's plan soon becomes evident as they infiltrate the lives of an unsuspecting wealthy family. At first through subtle, seemingly innocent actions, but becoming increasingly more sinister as their plans fall into place. The film has a few interesting twists. Kang-ho Song is excellent as usual. He is an incredibly versatile actor. I've seen him in comedies, action movies, horrors and thrillers and he simply never disappoints.

The setting in the big mansion is really awesome, versus the dilapidated neighborhood the antagonist family comes from. The behavioral differences are also very effectively illustrated. Although some moments might be considered too convenient to be realistic, the execution thereof is excellent, making this yet another classic, unforgettable Korean thriller.","Oct 29, 2019"
8,Twofer--sort of,"Parasite is certainly not boring, and the cinematography is exquisite. Is it a masterpiece? I am not convinced. The work is multigeneric, with the first half bearing nearly no resemblance to the second half. I suspect that those who found the first half appealing would be, albeit surprised, not necessarily pleased by the second half. On the other hand, people who found the first half to be too slow and perhaps even boring may have loved the action-packed second half. I see the influence of Tarantino in part 2, and the Cohen brothers throughout, which I have been noticing more and more in recent films.

Good but not great, given loose ends and dubious stereotypes and nonsequiturs. Great films are perfect, with everything fitting together so that nothing can be removed without making it worse. This creation, in contrast, is more sensationalist. While it is surprising, and no one could guess the ending from the beginning, that is mainly because of the shock effect of scenes such as the sewers spilling out all over during a torrential rainstorm. And, of course the complete switch to an entire different genre.","Dec 13, 2020"
8,Dark approach from a lighter style discussing a heavy theme,"Parasite probably is one of well-advertised Palm D'Or recipient when it is commercially released in my country, even some of our famous directors like the movie. However, after watching this movie, my friend is confused because she can't point a finger about what's the topic of the movie.

Advertised as ""tragicomedy"", Gisaengchung probably doesn't have a firm genre to stand with, since dramedy is heavily used in the first half before continue the movie with more thriller solution. In the surface, we understand what's this movie about. A poor family starts to ""leech"" on a rich family without told that they are one. Some scenes provide laughs and eerie feeling, but it's not escalating until the second half, when more bloody scenes are showing, but not with much explanation.

Since the second half aren't that long, I found that as an audience we must dissect the nature of the action, making a real difference than the light first half. When thinking, I slowly understand that this movie is a rich vs poor act that have to be buried because it will makes chaos. The chaos, gives a ""dark"" approach to the theme, but sugarcoated with some tragic and comedy nature of the movie.

The dissecting itself what maybe can't swallowed at one time like my friend. Unfortunately, upon having the realization, this movie doesn't give me that much impression like the others say. Nevertheless, it's still a highly recommended viewing option.","Jul 4, 2019"
8,See the potential Oscar-winner before it's spoiled for you!,"'Parasite' is a South Korean family drama/black comedy, with some great acting and a unique premise. It doesn't take long to establish the characters, but does well to give us time to get to know them. It's essentially the tale of two families: the Kim's - Dad Ki-taek (Kang Ho), Mum (Hyae Jin), Son Ki-woo (Woo Shik) & Daughter Ki-jung (So Dam), and the Park's - Dad Dong-ik (Sun Kyun), Mum Yeon-kyo (Yeo Jeong), Son Da-song (Jung) & Daughter Da-hye (Ziso).

The Kim's are poor, living in the 'slums', when Ki-woo gets a job tutoring Da-hye at the Park's nice house on the other side of Seoul. Even though there's symmetry in the parents/son/daughter, this isn't an 'Us' scenario, but rather an exploration of class, social status and unconscious biases. There's no ""good guys"" or ""bad guys"" - just a semi-realistic depiction of one family seeing the greener grass on the other side and taking an unconventional approach to get there.

All of the actors are great, with a nice mix of fun and humour, with seriousness and desperation. The twist at the end of the second act is both unexpected and still poses a lot of questions - there's a few different ways it could've played out. Not quite a one-location film, but the house does serve as an extra character. Good score and cinematography. The ending is a fitting mix of bittersweet, devastating and hopeful.","Feb 1, 2020"
8,Another very educational movie.,"Problem with Bong's movies is that they have very strong message. Snowpiercer, Okja, and now Parasite. Problem is that they're Bong's perspectives. And he wants to shove it down the audience's throat. And it's again apparent in this movie. It's painfully clear what he's trying to say in this movie... so apparent that it's immature. He's almost telling you what to feel and think at each moment.

And this trend in movies thesedays troubles me. In the old days, movies just told a story. And what each audience takes away are all their own and mostly different. What someone got out of Rocky was different that someone else. Now it's all telling you what to feel and what to think. And this trend is evident in games as well. Before, you had to explore and use creativity to solve puzzles and quests. Now, the games all tell you where to go and what to do. People are getting dumber and dumber thanks to these type of games and movies. It's actually opposite of what this movie is trying to say.","Aug 20, 2019"
8,Jaw Drop,"Wow. Definitely deserved the Best Picture Win at the Oscars!

8,Parasite Really Bites,"Parasite bites, in a good way. It bites you and doesn't let go, ever.

Parasite is a Korean film with sub-titles that tells the story of a poor, lower-working class family that is struggling to get by. Father, mother, son, and daughter. They all have the important 'survival' gene that poor people need to get by - street smarts, improvisation, and slick with words.

When the son gets asked by a friend to substitute for him as an English teacher to a high school girl in a rich family, the plot takes off. Through outright lies and trickery, the poor family weaves its way into the lives of the rich family, becoming very intertwined in various ways.

The father is the ring leader, but he is happy to let his kids get things started. He tries other ways to earn money, none of them very successful. But the kids break thru, and the family thinks they have hit the motherlode with the rich family. Until, the tide turns and soon, they are fighting for their new lives.

Everything leads up to a brutal ending that leaves you stunned, sad, breathless, but still a little hopeful.

The director does a clear job of showing that the rich family has no clue what it is like to struggle to survive. They live on a hill in a huge house designed by a famous architect, while the poor family lives in a basement apartment that would fit into one of the rich family's rooms. There is a terrible scene during a heavy rainfall that highlights the plight of the poor. The director strongly shows you that the rich family worries are about things that the poor can't even conceive of worrying about because they are struggling to survive. The rich vs poor dichotomy permeates the film in every scene.

This film is about survival and about the struggles of the lower class vs how the rich live in their own world that can't even stand the smell of poverty. You see that theme played out in several different scenes.

The cinematography does a great job of showing closeup facial expressions and camera angles so you are in the scene, either in the poverty or in the rich. Certain scenes were too dark and I could not easily tell what was happening. This made me think of Transformer movies where robots fight but you can't tell who is who or who is winning.

The absolute star of the film is the rich family's wife. She is a terrific actress. Her character is the epitome of the deluded wealthy who have to find problems where there are none, and who is easily tricked out of her money. But she doesn't care because money is like air to her.

The acting is really great, by everyone. I didn't see the point of introducing a Romeo and Juliet like interaction. It seemed like that was thrown in there.

Otherwise, the story was biting, and keeps you wondering what is going to happen, how can this possibly work out?

Parasite is worth your while. Great story. Great acting. Tough ending. Enjoy.","Dec 29, 2021"
8,An amazing movie,"Parasite is an exceptional, innovative and unforgettable movie in expression and form. Movie music is quite fit and suitable in every scene.

There are some flaws but overall a wonderful piece of cinema beautifully crafted.","Feb 11, 2020"

8,A Genre-Bending Dark Masterpiece,"Parasite, is a cinematic triumph that defies initial expectations and delivers a rich, multi-layered experience. Initially, the title and cover image might suggest a horror film about a literal parasite, but the reality is a fascinating exploration of social dynamics and human ingenuity.

Mise-en-Scène: (4/5) The film shines in its use of mise-en-scène, where the contrast between the Park family's luxurious home and the Kim family's modest apartment vividly illustrates the socioeconomic divide. The design of each setting not only enhances the story but also visually reinforces the themes of class disparity. The careful attention to detail in the set design, costumes, and props creates a powerful visual narrative that adds depth to the film's exploration of social issues.

Sound Design: (5/5) The sound design in Parasite significantly enriches the viewing experience. The film's score and sound effects are meticulously chosen to complement the mood and enhance the narrative. The transition from light-hearted to more intense music effectively heightens tension and underscores the film's emotional shifts. The use of silence and natural ambient sounds adds a layer of realism and immersion, making the film's atmosphere even more engaging.

Storytelling and Narrative: (5/5) Parasite excels in its storytelling, maintaining a gripping pace with a blend of dark comedy, suspense, and drama. The film's narrative structure is designed to keep audiences engaged and constantly reevaluating their expectations. Through clever storytelling and thematic depth, the film invites viewers to reflect on societal issues and the complexities of its characters' lives.

Final Thoughts: Parasite stands out not just for its entertainment value but also for its thought-provoking themes and unexpected narrative developments. Its ability to blend genres and challenge audience perceptions makes it a memorable and impactful film. By combining strong visual storytelling, innovative sound design, and a compelling narrative, Parasite offers a cinematic experience that lingers long after the credits roll.

Overall Rating: 8/10.","Sep 11, 2024"

8,The Basement Revelation,"One of the most shocking and memorable scenes in Bong Joon-ho's ""Parasite"" is the revelation of the hidden basement in the Park family's luxurious home. This pivotal moment serves as a turning point in the film, unraveling a complex web of secrets and escalating the tension to new heights.

Why It Stands Out:

Surprising Twist:

The basement revelation is a masterful plot twist that completely changes the dynamics of the story. Up until this point, the narrative follows the Kim family's strategic infiltration of the wealthy Park household. The discovery of the basement, and the people hiding within it, adds an unexpected layer of complexity and intrigue.

Character Reactions:

The reactions of the characters during this scene are incredibly well-acted and authentic. The shock and horror of the Kim family, the desperation of the former housekeeper, and the obliviousness of the Park family create a dramatic and multifaceted interaction that heightens the tension.","Jun 25, 2024"
8,"Old idea, novel execution","Parasite is a gripping and unsettling film that combines elements of black comedy and social commentary to great effect. The film tells the story of a impoverished family of four who scheme their way into becoming employees for a wealthy family, only to discover a dark secret that threatens their lives and livelihoods. With its masterful direction, compelling performances and original screenplay, Parasite is a thought-provoking film that leaves viewers questioning the nature of class and privilege in society. This is a very original work of art that would definitely capture your attention, no matter whether you're a casual movie watcher or an experienced cinephile.","Jun 18, 2024"
8,metphorical,"""Parasite"" is a Korean movie which won the highest award in Cannes International Film Festival. It is about the Kim family which live in semi-basement flat in Seoul. They do not have enough income and straggle for money, so Kim's son becomes the English tutor for the daughter of the rich Park family. Other members of Kim family take various measures and follow the son. Kim's daughter becomes the art teacher for the Park's young son, Kim's mother is hired as a housekeeper and father is hired as a driver. Like this, Kim's family get the jobs in Park's family, and it develops into an unexpected situation. I like this movie for 2 reasons. First, it keeps me in suspense. There are meany exciting scenes. Second, it tells us metaphorical message of the gap between the wealthy life and the poor life. It is expressed in contrast, and it makes me think various things.

8,"Status envy breeds evil, with redemption found in repentance than in genuine moral conviction.","So the 996th title for me was 'Parasite', where status envy breeds evil, with redemption found in repentance than in genuine moral conviction.

Personally, I consider cinema artful when it lays by the wayside, experiences that are commonly available to us, and thereafter presents a narrative that defies such common experiences.

Poor people smelling funny was one of the reasons some of my national law school acquaintances wouldn't ride the delhi metro - something that agitated me, but far from such behaviour being a 'morbid distaste for the poor' as the film's leftist reviewers would point out - it's merely an outcome of their socio-economic realities where their lifestyles are cocooned. It's nothing that is maliciously intentioned.

That's why, Parasite failed to enthuse me as much as it seemed to have enlivened reviewers to become a concert of uniform appreciation. I take that to be more a sign of the Marxist class consciousness becoming mainstream in our times than a sincere and objective appreciation of the cinematic mode.

It should be said that the rising popularity of such class consciousness could have made it possible for both - such a theme to be adapted for the screen, and for the reviewers to overlook the lack of artfulness.

Far from 'shocking' and 'emotionally riveting' ending that induces gasps as per The Guardian's film reviewers, the film lazily climaxes through a chaotic ending and tries to paper over the dangerous rationalization of poor people engaging in lies, deceit, and violence against the rich. Criminal and unethical behaviour is not warranted against anyone - irrespective of any markers of personal identity.

Half-way through the reel, the film did issue a poser: another one of the common experiences I spoke of earlier - whether 'niceness' is a result of being 'financially well-off'?

As answers to that poser, the poor husband and his wife held opposing views in a binary. However, the film does not even try to portray any tension in any of the characters with respect to that binary. The characters were straightjacketed into fixed outlooks on life - with the poor father redeeming his crookedness only after being at the receiving end of pain. Without further deliberation or exposition of that poser, one would tend to think that it was inserted more for effect than as part of a well thought out thematic tapestry.

In fact, I find it shocking that review after review imagines the film to be an exegesis of the growing inequality, class divide, and immobility of social classes. It shouldn't happen - that bad or criminal behaviour is passed off as justifiable under any circumstances, not so, especially in a democracy, where political equality is unshakeable and which guarantees a form of equality that is more powerful and capable of overcoming barriers to class immobility through modern welfare states and well functioning institutions.","Apr 11, 2021"
8,It's about the message,"It took some years for me to finally see this movie and I'm still not sure how to place it.

The most important thing about this movie is its message.

It's about the Kim family living their harsh life in South Korea as they are without a job and without any perspective. On the opposite there is the Park Family living a privileged life in their luxurious home.

By coincidence both lives get tangled up and there are apparently two worlds colliding. The story is very witty and the movie is sometimes funny, sometimes dark but never boring.

For me this movie is quite entertaining but not that mind-blowing as some might think.","Mar 14, 2024"
8,"Wonderfully funny, warm, surprising, and beautiful...though not ever astonishing","Parasite (2019)

With the hype around this movie (""best in ten years"") I had unreasonable expectations. This is a funny, almost silly story with great acting, and with a couple of twists that make it inventive. It's also filmed (photographed) with gorgeous care, lots of gently moving camera, a lot of planning of shots from one to the next to tell the story visually. It's an example of classic great moviemaking. I thought the acting was especially sharp, like the complex job the leading woman, Yeo-jeong Jo, had of seeming a bit ditzy and selfish and yet not completely lost at sea. And the rest of the cast played types that didn't tumble into stereotypes. The story was smart enough to give them room to be complex, but this isn't a probing complex movie, actually. The content is in the improbable situation and how it leads, almost in a Chaplin-like building of absurdities, to comic tension. The cameraman, Kyung-pyo Hong, deserves credit, for sure, because he holds the visual structure together in a range of scenes-racing down dingy steps, a downpour in the slums, and graceful geometry in the fabulous house. Director Bong Joon Ho deserves the praise he is getting. That said, the next thoughts are more a reaction to the praise it's been getting: there are more impressive movies out there in various ways. Even just this year there are movies that have movied me more, or made me laugh more, or were more inventive. (I'm not naming movies.) Maybe since this movie manages all three it's notable, but I'll keep my admiration in place! Enjoy it!","Feb 3, 2020"
8,A great discovery as a film director,"This film has undeniable cinematographic qualities, as its director has accustomed us to. The camera is fine, the editing effective and the music relevant while remaining discreet. The scenario has some nice surprises in store for us and the actors play very well, but we should, if possible, avoid the French version which takes away credibility from the characters. Why 8 and not a higher rating? Because the director fails in his attempt to make us develop empathy towards his main characters. The angle he chooses leads us to find them more talented than likeable. Watching this film is an experience you have to live!","Jan 12, 2025"

8,Well-made is a word for this.,"For me, Bong Joon-Ho's movies were clearly not my type before, because I thought they were too boring, I had to quit while I'm watching all those his movies, except Snowpiercer.

Anyway, since I was in theatre, and I have never left a theatre before, and also was thinking that I have never gonna watch this movie again, so I fought against my desire to leave. That, was my best movie-related choice of that year.

Even though first half was little boring as similar as other works of his, maybe too loose. But, as the scene goes by, tremendously natural looking visual effects, plots, and details were getting so tight and natural, concentration level of myself was also increased.

I felt the mise en scène of every scenes were highly calculated, and there were some scenes that doesn't fit the standard rules of ratio or direction and arrangement , but even those things that supposed to look like mistakes were pretty. That was the moment that I felt the director is so talented.

Parasite was an opportunity to make me able to think, watch and feel a movie in a different perspective. So, even though Bong-Joon-Ho's works are not my type of movies, I was highly inspired by this one.","Aug 22, 2023"
8,Fantastic!,"This movie is amazing in almost every way.

The acting is compelling and fleshed out, the story is believable and leaves you thinking for months after seeing it and the simple setting leaves it easy to get into and understand.

The commentary it has on the class system is spectacularly built and it well deserved it's Oscar.

The one flaw pulling this from impeccable is I felt it drag throughout its first half which left me leaning for my phone a couple of times early on. But these moments were short and I was pulled back in very quickly ready for it to blow my mind throughout its second and third act.

You gotta watch this!","Jul 17, 2023"
8,Could have been better,"This movie's story was brilliant, however, it felt rushed. I was confused about what the plot was until a little less than 90 minutes in, out of a 2+ hour movie. The real story it reveals is very engaging, but it doesn't start until at least 60-40 minutes in. From my understanding of the plot, there could have been at least 10 minutes cut short from the beginning, and the story would still be fine.

It had trouble engaging me. The rising action wasn't ""rising"" for me until 10 minutes before the climax it felt. The ending and climax were worth it, but waiting two hours felt too long. If anyone could explain why some scenes are important, I'd love to know, but other than that, it's just good. Could have been better, and could have been worse. I do think this is a good movie to watch, and I do recommend it.","May 5, 2023"

It's very good, but if you've watched a good amount of Korean thrillers before it won't exactly blow you away. It has the slow burn that leads to a violent climax, dark humor... even the class warfare themes that are common in Korean movies.

The main one being; all of the events feeling ridiculously coincidental. Another one is; -still under the coincidentiality umbrella but with a slight twist- a common issue that I tend to realize in above-average-budgeted international movies. They sometimes want to tell too many things when they didn't really need to, which ends up muddying up the overall balance of the main story.

8,"""Dad, today I made a plan""","Winner of four Oscars in 2020, ""Gisaengchung"" (2019) deserves all the positive repercussion it has achieved, being one of the most important thriller works of the past decade.

The mix of styles makes Bong Joon Ho's direction unique and magical, mixing thriller with dark comedy, drama, horror and several other genres. The performance of the entire cast is fundamental to the composition of the work, with each actor delivering very convincing and striking performances, especially the main family. The frames presented in the scenes are incredible and memorable, creating an atmosphere of total immersion for the viewer. During the second act, the film marks a transition in atmosphere, turning more towards a thriller, although it maintains the acid comedy at certain moments, with a notable melancholic aura.

More than a simple film, the plot presents clear criticisms of class division, the toxic interdependence between rich and poor, and socioeconomic inequalities in South Korea, illustrating two families that follow completely different worlds, even though they coexist in the same society. ""Gisaengchung"" is indispensable for any fan of out-of-the-box works, being yet another great milestone for talented South Korean cinema.","Jul 17, 2024"
8,Best Picture 2020,"I had high expectations for this film as it was the Best Picture of 2020. It simply would not have been my choice.

Straight off the bat, the cinematography paired with the color scheme and score pulled me in. Much of the music in the film was haunting and effective, though at times, it fell completely flat, indulging in string clichés, which seemed to contradict the original nature of Parasite.

Parasite is unlike any film I've seen in several regards. It takes a while for the plot to settle in. It's rather special as the circumstances unravel. It is genre-bending and defying. The film shifts in tone several times, which I found refreshing. However, I was both indifferent and negative in response to integral directions taken in the final act.

I appreciate that every single character was flawed and that many of our protagonists were irredeemable.

Slow burns are my favorite type of film. The pacing was mostly tolerable, though I do believe in being slightly condensed, it would be improved. The ending dragged out. We can gather much from what is told in one word. There were many moments that felt like watching a trailer of a greater film in part due to sound mixing, which was disappointing. If the editing was improved upon, I, again, would have enjoyed it more.

Stylistically, for the most part, Parasite is brilliant. Sure, it may have its faults, but it is still worlds upon worlds better than your average film. Does it align with my preferences? Mostly yes, but not entirely. If I preferred the directions taken, it would lean towards an 8 or perhaps even a 9 as the film is built on a remarkable foundation that I truly have never seen done before; it's frankly inspirational.

If there were some different decisions made and some of the editing was improved upon, again, I likely would have bumped this up to an 8 or a 9.

To most, Parasite is a masterpiece, and understandably so. On a technical basis, I am inclined to agree.

I recommend Parasite! :)","Apr 14, 2023"
8,"Great Expectation, Great Disappointment","I don't understand why this movie has received so much praise. I don't know the technical details of the movies, but this movie got 4 Oscars, 4 Oscars! The script was not top-notch, although sometimes surprising things happened while watching it. The acting was not outstanding either. I really don't understand what this movie has that can get 4 Oscars. Maybe it's my ignorance. I was very disappointed when the movie ended, my expectations were very high. The ending was not satisfying at all. Only unexpected things happened and the movie ended in a mess. This movie has the characteristics of an average movie. There's nothing legendary about it.","Jan 28, 2023"

8,Parasite (2019) A modern classic,"Parasite presents us with two completely different realities and their parallels. While the successful live a peaceful life, those with less money are living in precarious conditions. The rich cannot tarnish their image as good people and the poor need to pretend to be from a higher class to fit in among them. Parasite is an obvious criticism, but with subtexts that can generate several debates. The film shines by playing with different genres throughout the plot and carrying them out in an excellent way. Comedy, horror, drama, action and suspense are mixed in an extremely effective way, projecting a mix of emotions to the viewer, but never in a confusing way. Parasite is one of the greatest works of the 21st century. An excellent review, an excellent film and a modern classic.","Nov 26, 2023"
8,MASTERFUL PRODUCTION. OK STORY.,"It is undeniable that this is a master at work. The movie is very well shot, acted & edited. It is undeniable that Bong Joon Ho led the warship masterfully through the abyss of the genre & I do believe that should be pointed out.

However, the reason the movie is a 7 & not a 10 is pretty much because the story is simply okay. The movie shines at its best when it goes into the grey areas, talking about rich people being so nice because they are rich & not making the movie about the idiotic correlation between wealth & evil.

Yet, it falls short on that regard since this is what this movie ends up being about. Poor people smell bad & rich people will point in out.

Simple. Regressive. Wrong.","Dec 31, 2022"
8,Well made movie.. brings up interesting themes,"I do feel this movie is really well made. Alot of things worked well and the movie was enjoyable. I liked the mix of humor and darkness. I really enjoyed the actors and the way the movie was put together.

I'm still working on what the movie was trying to say. Maybe the message wasn't supposed to be clear to the audience.. but some aspects just felt a little muddled and cliche.

Despite the story issues which I felt didn't all make sense.. still a really powerful and interesting movie. Well done.","Oct 23, 2019"
8,A very strange but even more original movie,"This is certainly one of the strangest movies I have ever seen. (Others have already summarized the plot, so I won't go over that again here.) Indeed, it kept getting stranger and more unpredictable with each new scene.

It is, however, also one of the most imaginative and creative films I have seen. I would most certainly recommend it to anyone open-minded enough to handle something that is perpetually unforeseeable.

My only problem was the subtitles. I saw the movie tonight here in France with French subtitles. Half the time I could not read the white subtitles against a light or white background. It is so easy to put a black cartouche around the subtitles to make them always readable. Sure, you lose a little of the original image, but that's better than losing your audience for half the picture.

Something distributors need to rethink.","Aug 23, 2019"
8,Meets it's reputation,"This is a great film.

The direction and camera work is masterful.

The characterization and acting is great.

The story is compelling.

Things are going along interestingly in the movie. And then a twist comes.

It's a good one and the twist knocks the movie into another direction(in a good way).

The twist is well timed.

And, importantly for me, plausible. It doesn't contradict the whole rest of the movie like so many twists do.

This movie is an interesting story that's well told. There's various kinds of tension and it remains engaging.

It's also worth noting it's very accessible for a foreign drama film. I watch foreign films all the time but for those who aren't familiar will find it easy to follow and get into.

Now this film won the staggering achievement of getting a Best Picture Oscar for a foreign film. Something that hasn't happened before.

And I think it does deserve it.

There is alot of subtext about class and inequality and money. The movie explores it in an interesting way.

Finally, the movie works up to a crescendo of an ending that is really impactful.

Highly recommended.","Aug 10, 2024"
8,A fine example of cinema enjoyed as a collective experience,"Parasite is a film that represents that cinema is best as a collective experience. From the beginning until the end of the film the audience was silent, without being distracted, immersed in the reality that the film presents. The script, in terms of structure, works like a clock: the characters, the scenarios, the conflicts are raised, and each element will influence what happens next. The staging is magnificent: an exact combination of photography, editing and direction that manages to maintain attention and tension in each sequence: the way in which each member of the family is gets work at the house, the sequence of the arrival of the family after ""the camp"", the children's party of the climax ... They are very well executed sequences and together they manage to maintain a rhythm as I have rarely seen this year in the cinema. The message of social class difference is clear but very in your face, especially when what happens after the storm is evident. My only buts are that there are parts of the plot that feel forced to cause impact, and although they work, they are not entirely convincing. And that in the cinema I seek to leave inspired, not with my head down, and this film is very entertaining but ends up overwhelming the mood. Even so, for provoking that community experience in a movie theater through the extraordinary use of cinematic language it is worth the recommendation.","Jan 1, 2020"
8,Great movie,"It has everything. It's funny, it's sad and it will make you fuming. You will feel with all the characters. The ending had me for a while; at the end it gives you another type of twitst. A very good movie. 8/10","Mar 7, 2021"
8,Diversity in genre,"The central theme of ""Parasite"" is the stark contrast between the wealthy Parks and the impoverished Kims. Bong Joon-ho uses the architecture of the Parks' house to symbolize this divide, with the Kims literally and figuratively living below the surface, aspiring to rise to the heights of the Parks' opulent lifestyle. The verticality of the set design emphasizes the social ladder that the Kims are attempting to climb.

The film explores the corrupting influence of greed. The Kims' initial deception is driven by necessity, but as they become more entrenched in the Parks' lives, their schemes grow more elaborate and morally dubious. The Parks, while not evil, are depicted as oblivious and entitled, highlighting how wealth can insulate individuals from the harsh realities faced by those less fortunate.

""Parasite"" examines how economic status affects relationships. The Parks and the Kims interact within a clear hierarchy, with the Parks often treating the Kims as invisible or less-than-human. However, the relationship between the two families becomes more complex as they are forced to confront their interdependence, culminating in moments of tension and unexpected empathy.

The discovery of the hidden basement is a pivotal moment that reveals the hidden lives and secrets of the characters. This basement represents the unseen underclass that supports the comfortable lives of the wealthy. The film's title, ""Parasite,"" alludes to this symbiotic relationship, where both the Kims and the Parks can be seen as parasites in different ways.

Bong Joon-ho's direction is meticulous, employing a range of cinematic techniques to enhance the narrative. The use of space within the Parks' house is particularly notable, with its sleek, modern design contrasting sharply with the cramped, dingy Kim apartment. The camera work often emphasizes this spatial and social divide, using wide shots to showcase the lavishness of the Parks' home and tight, confined angles to depict the Kims' environment.

The film's pacing and tone shift dramatically in the second half, moving from dark comedy to intense thriller. This transition is handled deftly, maintaining suspense and emotional engagement. The score by Jung Jae-il complements this shift, with music that underscores the tension and escalating stakes.","Jun 30, 2024"
8,Myth of meritocracy under a looking glass,"The responses this film draws are often a study of internalized propaganda; specifically, the smoke screen of meritocracy that attempts to cover the systemic injustices of the world. The common thread is to object to the impoverished characters as being portrayed as too capable; the ""If you're so smart, why aren't you rich?"" saying being an epitome of this mindset. It's a saying that you could hear in a schoolyard, because it betrays a childish level of understanding, or lack thereof: not considering unearned wealth transfer; not considering the disparity of opportunities; and not considering that the wealth gap is particularly large in South Korea.

It's unclear how many people who are willingly ignorant about injustice can be reached at all, but art like this film must help, at the very least by sustaining a discussion of the topic of injustice and inequality.","Feb 11, 2020"
8,Quite the journey...,"Parasite starts with an endearing family of characters and continues the familial theme until the cows come home. The direction and photography are impeccable, but perhaps not worth the watch time.

While I wanted to see the family get into more hijinks (my favorite act was the 1st), the story decided to sit at this house of rich people (to examine the class divide I imagine), and I was a little disappointed.

However, the house holds a few remarkable secrets, and the anxiety I felt watching this family blend in was palpable, and it didn't hurt that the actors had great chemistry and humor going.

I also enjoyed how the naturalistic directing style contrasted with the insanity of the last act.

Give it a watch!","Sep 9, 2022"
8,Parasite Interesting & Entertaining,"Again, I had little to go on coming into my viewing of Parasite, which I think is always best. The story and its telling are clever, interesting and at times thought provoking. The cast is uniformly fine, not great, but fine. I won't repeat the storyline here as its been told enough but I will speak to elements of it. The poor and clever class and the wealthy and not so bright class are both painted a little broadly and predictably for me. The very bloody, 'Tarantino' like ending was also a bit over the top as well. Still, Bong Joon Ho does a fine job in creating what I think is a fresh and unique film experience definitely worth checking out.","Sep 22, 2022"
8,Good movie,"An unemployed family with rude, unsuccessful parents and over-aged, unsettled children, thanks to a smile of luck and their own not the most honest actions, penetrates into a rich house. Those who want to improve their financial situation, arrogant, determined, grasping and quite capable, Kims do not want to remain in the position of service personnel and begin to try on the role of hosts... But could they have assumed that someone else had ""dug in"" here for a long time, and he would not give up his place at a full refrigerator so easily... The whole story, full of unexpected twists, tragic outcomes and grotesque caricature, seems to me like a tracing paper that can be applied to many socio-economic cataclysms: from labor migration to civil wars and revolutions. An interesting film, outwardly comedic, full of ABSURDITY, but suggestive of associations.","Jan 20, 2022"
8,"Intriguing, entertaining and surprising","I watched this with no preconceptions - I knew it was Korean, and I knew it was laden with awards. But I didn't have a clue about the story. So I won't spoil anything in this review.

It's easy to be be seduced by the style of this film. Calm, controlled camerawork and beautiful cinematography that makes full use of the available light, colour and weather.

The story draws you in too. Perhaps a little slowly at first, but it reaches a fantastic climax, navigating through various genres as it gets there. It's an inspired bit of storytelling.

But there are a few things that stop it from being a true masterpiece. The first hour is a little too slow. The combination of the subtitles and the low-key performances of several lead characters make it quite hard for a non-Korean speaking viewer to understand their motivations. And the greatest shame is that the final act is unconvincing when compared to what has preceded it.

But well worth watching. The second hour is a stunning piece of cinema.","Feb 23, 2021"
8,film,"Hello dear friends and readers!

Well, I finally got to the film ""Parasite"", about which there are already so many reviews, despite the fact that the film is completely ""fresh"", 2019.

I am not very familiar with Korean cinema, if not to say that I am not familiar with it at all. I'm not fond of dramas - I tried to watch something somehow, but no, everything is too naive and enthusiastic for me. Therefore, to be honest, the film ""Parasite"" also began to watch with a little apprehension - however, what am I risking? If the film doesn't work, if I don't like it, I'll turn it off and start watching something else, there's a big problem.

So, as you already understood, the film ""Parasite"" is made in South Korea.

I must say right away that, it seems to me, the title of the film does not quite fit the plot, it is somehow wrong, confusing. I would call the film ""Swindlers"", ""Liars"", ""Deceivers"", well, or something like that ... Nevertheless, in Russian the meaning of the word ""parasites"" has a slightly different connotation - in Wiki ""Parasite (trans.) - a person living on other people's means, at the expense of other people's labor, a parasite (social parasite)"". And in the film, the family worked on its own, and therefore earned money relatively honestly.

In general, the film is very good - dynamic, sometimes unpredictable. Yes, and the quality of filming, the acting - all this pleased me.

I will not retell the plot, but I will say about it very briefly. The guy gets a job in one fairly wealthy family and then, by hook or by crook, drags both his sister and his parents to work there. How it will turn out for both families, you will learn from the film.

I can recommend the tape ""Parasite"". But still I don't share the general enthusiasm, for me the film turned out to be a one-off. I looked and even got a portion of the positive. But I definitely won't revise this film, and I'm unlikely to remember it after a couple of months.","Jan 19, 2022"

8,Movie script of Parasite is clearly stolen from Taiwan But it is good show,"The movie script of Parasite is clearly taken from Taiwanese president, Tsai Ing-Wen's London School of Economic and Political Science (LSE) Ph. D Degree investigation by commentator of True Voice of Taiwan, Dennis Peng Ph. D and American Journalist Michael Richardson.

Tsai claims she received 1.5 Ph. D degree from LSE in 1984, but The Council of the London School of Economics and Political Science in a November 26th 2021 statement to British Information Commissioner's Office denies that LSE have Tsai Ing-wen's Ph. D thesis examiners' names and date of examination. Oddly enough that Tsai's application to New York attorney license in 1987 did not even mention that she has 1.5 Ph. D degree from the University. All these evidences point to Tsai never received any Ph. D degree from the University of London neither one, or one and a half.

Currently, Taiwanese is prohibited from looking into Tsai higher academic records by an order from Tsai's government; the order seals her records from public eye for thirty years. Dr. Peng is a fugitive wanted by Tsai government and currently in exile in the US.

LSE records show, in Tsai's own writing, that Tsai dropped out of LSE Ph. D programme in 1983 because of financial difficulty. She returned to Taiwan and began to fabricate her credentials to gain various higher posts.

Tsai's scam came to light in 2015 but failed to wake Taiwanese; this is the timeline when the Korean film maker picked up the story. Soon after Tsai took power, Taiwan's National Communication Commission (NCC) began to clamp down news outlets and shut a TV station to quiet the dissenting voices. Also, Taiwan's Central Election Commission is now run by a Democratic Progressive Party leader known to falsify legal document and the commission is staffed with Eagle Eye troopers who are the most avid supporters of Tsai. The impact of DPP control of the electoral commission is evident by the passages of importing of European Union banned ractopamine-containing pork into Taiwan and destruction of a unique 7500 years coral reef; the destruction of reef carries a huge if not irreversible ecologic impact that may lead to the loss of a global treasure.

Every Taiwanese knows the movie Parasite is poking fun at Taiwan for its fame for protecting scammers. Taiwanese strongly objects the Korean film maker publicize President Tsai's scandal and morph her story into a movie for monetary gain and to shame Taiwan.

While enjoying the film but I also felt the hurt that Korean pouring on Taiwan.","Dec 24, 2021"
8,Parasite,"An impoverished family scams a wealthy family by misleading them to think they are qualified for the wealthy family's needs. After settling comfortably in their home, things go awry when the Kim family discovers a secret hidden inside the Parks family home.

Directed by Bong Joon-Ho, the film's direction explores economic inequality and social division. The film's symbolism indicates how the Kim family's greed for the wealth of the Parks family is similar to a parasite feeding on larger animals to survive. However, it also suggests how the wealthy also takes advantage of the less fortunate by the abuse of their power. An interesting take on capitalism.

The performances from the main cast were entertaining. The performances enhanced the amusing scenes throughout the film. The main cast portraying the Kim family did a brilliant job with their roles as con artists. A thrilling film that blends social consciousness and dark comedy brilliantly.","Feb 23, 2022"

Parasite reminded me that there are actually some original ideas out there being made into movies. It also reminded me how annoyed I am by all of the sequels and remakes and reboots that have flooded Hollywood and American mainstream movie theaters. Directed and co-written by Bong Joon Ho, who also directed Snowpiercer and Okja both of which are on Netflix, Parasite is a South Korean film with English subtitles about... well, this where reviewing this movie gets difficult because I don't want to spoil anything. Um... it's about an out of work family who through a series of events find work and surprising things occur.

There is so much to admire about Parasite. The screenplay is so good because, while the setting may be foreign to American audiences, the story is familiar and takes unexpected turns that when you really think about them the turns were always somehow inevitable. The point of view is funny and insightful. The themes once completely revealed are devastatingly universal.

A further boon to Parasite is that the cast is great. Each member of the cast gets to shine in their distinct ways. The chemistry is familial and easy. The father played by Song Kang Ho and the daughter played by Park So Dam are the standouts; but, uniformly, each character plays their essential part in this tale. I'll also note how the production design is architecturally awe-inspiring and meticulous. The sets that were built for the film tell just as much of the story by just existing as do the dialogue and the actors.

Parasite is an absolute must see. If it is in a theater near you, take the opportunity to enjoy this spectacle on the big screen. Do not read any spoilers. Go into this one knowing as little as possible.","Jan 7, 2020"

8,Parasite,"Unique,elegant with a different point? The movie is really good and the fact that cleverness is all we need is in this movie. Shows the difference between the rich and the poor in a different way. The last part is quite unsatisfied! But the family got broke both the family ! Greediness has also it's own limit.","May 18, 2022"
8,Wow,"Parasite is a film capable of accompanying you in the narration halfway, hand by hand making you amazed and sometimes laugh at the situations that the family devises, then all of a sudden, the hand that accompanied you on that journey gives you a loud slap. And plunges you into an even more paradoxical situation, in which hatred and fear (which for the entire film remain slightly below the surface) take over, until the last scene that makes you understand the profound dramatic condition in which the family will have to live for years to come.","May 27, 2021"
8,Very interesting!,"The first half of the movie was slow but not in the bad way. It builds up each character, gives you an interesting story to keep your attention and shows the true nature of each of our main characters, all before the second half of the movie which is packed with tense moments that made me want to hold my own breath and ends with exactly what I wanted the story to end with, a great conclusion with a satisfying ending.

The music and acting throughout was great and made each scene shine as bright as it could. Overall, Parasite is a really good film and was really fun to watch, very interesting and would highly recommend!","May 22, 2021"

8,"8.3/10 - So Smooth and Accessible, Yet Provides Food for Thought","""All you'll need to do is walk up the stairs.""

Parasite is a 2019 South-Korean film, directed by Bong Joon-ho. You might've not heard about tons of Korean movies, but chances are that even someone (such as me) who needs to check out more Korean cinema has still heard something about Parasite. It's the highest grossing South-Korean film of all time, and the first non-English language film to ever win an Oscar for the best picture.

The movie follows a poor family and their struggles to make a living. When the son of the family gets an opportunity to work as an English tutor for the daughter of a rich family, he takes the job with no hesitation, lying a bit of light lies regarding his qualifications. Soon he learns that the mother of the family is rather easy to manipulate, and so the poor family begins to plot a scheme to completely infiltrate the household of the rich Parks family.

This one has something that I think anyone can appreciate when it comes to art - it's super accessible, but it still has enough depth so one can have an elaborate, film-nerd discussion regarding the film afterwards. Everything in this film just feels so smooth, so fluid and well-done: camera movement, editing, composition, everything just has this good flow that I really appreciate. Certain sequences especially bring that to the front, but it's present all throughout the film and I really love it.

There's also a cool blend of genres here - comedy and drama with some heist movie vibes and then, around the halfway point, there's this awesome shift that really get this film going, and in unexpected directions with much more weight to them. It's like there's this whole buildup in the first half of the movie, and then it turns out so abruptly to something darker and more thrilling. Really love this aspect of the movie. Well done.

And you know what? Pretty much every aspect of this film is well-done, to the point that I don't think that this film has any notable flaws. It doesn't automatically mean that the film is a 10/10 experience, only that it does what it tries to do in the best way possible, but still - the humor works for me, the acting is spot-on, the story is compelling and the social commentary gives some proper food for thought. This is one of those films that I'd probably recommend anyone who's old enough to watch an R-Rated film.

So yeah, this one's very good. Its flow and pacing are super satisfying, everyone's acting is spot-on, and the genres brought to the table here are woven together in a really unique way. It's accessible, but will also provide food for thought, and in the end of the day I truly think that almost everyone will enjoy this film. Feeling an 8.3/10 on this one.","Jul 1, 2023"
8,"A genuine movie, not a thriller","This Korean movie that took all of the Oscars back in 2019 is about a family that gets into a house of a rich family for money and they are doing several jobs. This is a very smart idea without a doubt, but there was a lot of hype because of how much of a thriller it is, which disappointed me because it was not a thriller for me, it was neither terrifying nor playing with Mt mind or something. It had its suspens but it was more of an action/ drama movie. OF COURSE IT WAS AN ABSOLUTE GREAT MOVIE.

At first I wasn't sure what to make of it but I soon realized an hour after watching it, I couldn't stop thinking about it. Everything is really solid and I can't think of much that I can point out and say that is wrong with the movie, it's the culmination of a bunch of really great individual pieces coming together to create something bigger - the whole is greater then the sum of its parts. I went in basically blind and I hope any future fans do too but if you're not convinced, tight and unique story, very suspenseful, and charming characters. If any of what I just said sounds interesting, you should go watch this movie. I'm only giving it 8 stars because while I think the movie is great, it doesn't show itself noticeably excel at anything that other movies don't, still very solid and I would highly recommend.","Feb 26, 2021"

Generally you care for them from the beginning and they keep being investing through the whole film. Bong Joon Ho newest film really captures you and is quite though provoking in general. The acting is very solid with the best performances coming from Kang-ho Song and Woo-sik Choi. The rest of the cast does marvelously as well. The setting is nice, offering the audience very nice and believable sets and beautiful pictures. Bong Joon Ho's direction is constantly good as he perfectly understands his characters, their motivations and generally gives the film a very nice flow you can easily follow and he makes sure you never lose interest in it.

I really enjoyed the movie - it was a great watch thru-and-thru, but I feel like the second half twisted too darkly too quickly, and the pacing in general, besides that, just seemed... Off to me.

In fact, it's a story about home invasion but not in a horror way but in a normal way, lower-class invades upper-class.

Even as it is spoken in a language that needs subtitles I had a smile on my face in some situations. But it's also weird what is happening in the basement. I had a bit of problems what is happening in the basement with the lights, it's funny but also a thing you can't believe.

But I agree, I understand for a flick coming out of a country not known for flicks that this is Oscar worthy. Excellent cinematography and top notch performances.

8,Brilliant storytelling - Definition of a Modern Kafka-esque film,"I loved this film! It's one of those films that astonish you and make you think about the film much after it has ended. It studies class divide in a post-modern world and has so many elements to it that one needs to watch a video explaining the film.

Sometimes it may feel over-exaggerating, but I can't fault the director for this style, which does truly make him the Kafka of our times.

Thank you for the film of the year and congratulations on being the first foreign language film to win the Oscar!","Jan 12, 2021"
8,not my favorit movie but I recommended,"I like this movie but the ending, everything is mix up for me. i just doesn't like the last one, that's all but i 100% recommended it though ....","Jan 1, 2021"
8,"Special, but no masterpice","So Parasite is good but certainly not a mega masterpiece. Something special, indeed, but don't expect too much. One can also interpret more than possible.

In terms of cinematography its rather average. good storytelling. good acting.

The movie has special moments, impacts that you dont expect. All in all, the socially critical background makes it special for me.","Feb 23, 2020"
8,Parasite (2019),"There is a real insurmountable hype surrounding Bong Joon-ho's latest film. Playing only in one theater in NYC and it was sold out all weekend. Luckily, I was able to go see an early showing of this film on my day off. The hype is real. I enjoyed this film and was glued to the screen for the entire duration of the film. Its, funny, smart, violent, and socially timely. Whatever, you do please go see Parasite as it is going to be one of the best films of the year and is one of my favorites already.

The film is about a poor family who live in a shabby basement and need money and struggle to survive. An opportunity comes for the son of the family as he forges documents and gets a job as a private tutor for a very wealthy family. Soon the rest of his family begin setting up situations where each of them get hired for the family. The family keep their identities hidden but soon come across dark situations and they must go to great lengths to protect their secret and their new found wealth.

Bong Jonon-ho's films are usually very well shot and there is no difference here. Everything is so pristine and each small detail tells a story. The script for this film is a mix of comedy and thriller and it works so well. The leading family in this film are desperate and in poverty so you want to identity with them but then you realize that this family do some terrible stuff for their own greed, even if it means hurting innocent people.

The film goes into the depths of exploring class differences and the gap between the wealthy and poor. It doesn't matter the country, this is just ever present everywhere. Its underlying and subtle at first but the theme resonates, especially through the patriarch of the family, portrayed by Song Kang-ho. I'm trying to find something to criticize about the film but am struggling to find things I didn't like. It is a fairly long film but it zooms by because of how entertaining it truly is.

This is of course the final season of the year and Oscar season is in full swing. Parasite should really be up there with a Best Picture nomination and I'd say is a strong contender for being the best film of the year. Its so mesmerizing in all regards. I might need to check out more South Korean films as I greatly appreciated Burning last year. I'm gonna reiterate, go and see this film.

8,Great Plot Twist,This movie tell us a story about a class struggle in South Korea. I like the plot twist.,"Aug 11, 2021"
8,"BAD ACTING, GREAT STORY AND Cinematography","At first glance you think this is going to be terrible. The acting is sooo bad. The rich guy walks with his head high, chest puffed up, almost like an animated character while the poor characters are crawling, bend over like Quasimodos ... It's way to much even for a slapstick comedy. It's sort of like GOT, once you discover that everyone on screen is acting really pourly you accept it, and go along with the story. And what a great story. A few minor plotholes but it doesn't matter. The cinematography and set design makes it all worth the while. Definitely watchable.

8,"Intense, thrilling, unexpected.","This film was... a lot. I mean that in the best way possible. It was the first movie that I watched in a long time that genuinely wanted to make me stand up, take a deep breath and scream ""WHAT THE-""

This is one of the first films I have watched in a language other than English with subtitles. I thought that I had this movie more or less figured out at the beginning, but it escalated just so damn quickly and turned from a comedy/heist film into a pretty messed up thriller/drama. Like, when it all started up, I was like ""oh, haha, funny comedy about a family scamming their way into the household of a richer family using entertaining and complex tactics, yay"" and then about halfway into the movie my brain just did a hard reset which went something along the lines of ""WHAT THE HELL IS HAPPENING AND WHAT THE HELL IS THIS MOVIE""

This film is so beautifully original and well-crafted, and throughout the entire thing there were so many levels which spoke truths about classism and the rich-poor divide. Bong Joon Ho is brilliant at creating an air of deadly suspense, and i was on the edge of my seat the entire time. Only after you finish the movie do you realise just how potent and genius that title is - who truly is the parasite? Wait - it's both of them.

The cinematography and the clean, modern feel was beautiful visually, and juxtaposed strikingly with the horror I kept seeing. And almost all the time, especially in the second half I had no idea what was happening and I had no idea what came next. And oh, the suspense - the way it was built gave me that sinking feeling in my stomach that something was about to go horribly, horribly wrong.

People have got to get over themselves when it comes to subtitles and discover the great foreign films such as this that are out there.

8,10 out of 10 easily,"Get your senses heightened. Parasite is one hell of a movie. It's so hauntingly simple and elegant, I couldn't believe what happened in the end. I just sat where I was, spellbound.

8,"Love the plot, the acting, and the script. The ending...","'Parasite' is a solid movie through and through. The Kim's devious ""no-plan"" to get themselves from their pitiful subterranean hole into a luxurious lifestyle is a unique one. Where the comedy comes into this movie is that they never think it through as is their intention, but their fumbles don't matter because the Parks are so gullible to begin with. Yeo-jung Cho's acting gives the best portrayal of anxiety and naivety that allows the audience to understand why the ""no-plan"" is so successful. And it's Kang-ho Song's positive and respectful Ki Taek, who absolutely steers the family ship, that makes the Kim's situation relatable and their deception forgivable. I will say that the ending, albeit catastrophic, did and yet didn't grip me. I doubt many feel the way I do about it. Maybe because as lovable as the Kims were, they were not innocent. The good times couldn't last forever. No lie of that magnitude survives long. And karma came for them horribly. While all the events of the finale did grip me in its moral context and its tragic somberness, when the film was over the lasting impression wasn't there because I felt the family that played with matches got burned as expected. But it's still poetic and still a beautiful film.","Feb 27, 2021"

8,Nice movie but...,"Typical social commentary movie. Yes its good, and yes it makes you think. Their are lots of details, and I love it when a director does not spoon feed the audience. My main grip is that at the end, the social commentary overrode the movie. IE the movie was always a bit unusual, but the ending was surreal. Not that it was a bad ending, it just felt disconnected from the rest of the narrative...","May 3, 2020"
8,Paradise,"""Parasites"" is dizzying, brilliant and completely unclassifiable. Director Bong Joon-ho is targeting an increasingly polarized society, where the rich get richer and the poor are left to struggle to survive. Clearly he has achieved his goal, the film is undoubtedly interesting, but it is also full of anger and a strong sense of injustice.","Jul 29, 2020"
8,"Great Plot, Great movie, but certainly not the greatest of the decade.","It was a really great and funny movie, but really predictable which makes it hard to say if it really is one of the greatest.

In fact, these differences have not changed since ancient times.

The final 50 min were not all that good in my opinion, and the (violent) behavior of some of the main protagonists defies logic. It's probably deserving of all the accolades because no better movie was released in 2019. I think Shoplifters (2018 palmes d'or) is as deserving if not a better picture than Parasite.","Jun 4, 2020"

But in the end, it fell into the usual pattern of Korean films. Now you can understand why the director said you couldn't tell the story, because if you did, it would be a lot less entertaining.

8,Gisaengchung,"The first third of them are very good-looking. I thought they were comic comedies. After the men in the basement came out, I thought six people would live together. I didn't expect that the plot would suddenly change. The director had to lead a story without any sense of reality to the cruelty of realism. As a result, it became more and more painful. The last one was especially stiff. Selina said there was a smell of death in the poor. The film's depiction of the poor is not as accurate and powerful as this sentence.","May 12, 2020"
8,Gisaengchung,"To be honest, I'm a little disappointed. It's really ingenious. It's a very good story. It's linked up and reversed. The performance of the actors is also excellent. But in the end, it fell into the routine of Korean movie. Now I can understand why the director said he can't play through, because if the play through, the visibility of the film will be greatly reduced. Satire, cold humor, and Reflections on social issues are all felt. But I'm sorry, it's not the palms I'm looking forward to.","May 12, 2020"

As representatives of the two classes, there is no direct hatred between the individual and the individual. It can even be said that uncle Kim's family is very grateful to representative park and thinks that Mrs. Park is simple and kind. The rich couple, on the other hand, did not specifically target the other class of people with any deliberately difficult and contemptuous. But there was still bad blood between the two classes, or between the two families.","May 16, 2020"

This is such a good movie. After hearing so much buzz about this film at the Oscars, somehow I still had no idea what the movie was about going into it.A great moment for Korean cinema and an extremely thought provoking film. Parasite tells the story of the Kim family and their life-changing involvement with the Park family. If you want to be told a story, but without too much detail upfront that would give it all away, sit down for this one.Boong Joon Ho directs this Oscar winning movie about the disreputable behaviour of a Korean family who infiltrate the home and lives of a wealthy couple by gradually taking over the roles of domestic helpers.The Parks family is the opposite of all of this.Naive,not so much - probably just out of touch with the real world. The first hour of the movie it was more of a comedy but after that everything changed.The whole ambiance changed, and I was literally shook all the time after that happened. The actors were great, the plot was super strong, and I can't say enough good things about how beautiful this film is just to look at.Though I really did enjoy the film, I personally, didn't think this deserved the Oscar win for best movie as although a strong and powerful tale, for me, there were better films in the preceding year. I also do not think this is the best of Boong Joon Ho's movies. However, the fact that it did win is to be applauded as a massive step forward in the recognition that there are movies made outside Hollywood.

It isn't an easy ride, and as with life in the real world, the destination is always uncertain. You'll see strange and wonderful things along the way. Parasite also perfectly presents the subject of classism, showing us how both the working class and the upper class view each other and the people around them.

Taking everything into account,Parasite is truly a work of art, a sheer masterpiece.","Apr 20, 2020"

The actors are greatly chosen as each one represents perfectly a kind of person (especial recognition to the rich mother, that acts really good).

8,A story well told,"Intellectually elite people look down on the kind of movies other people watch, the non funny jokes and the try too hard acting but it's not fair to except people to put in their brains in everything they do. Parasite meets the margins of great acting, direction, cinematography but what is the best thing is that it is not intellectually elite it serves a plain story like a flowing river and everyone can enjoy it. You can be far far away from this river and like it or choose to go into subtleties and like it. I also am glad that this Oscar winning movie is not just a heap of ache and pain as they usually are.","Apr 13, 2020"
8,Super entertaining and perfectly paced.,This is the perfect film. Subjectively speaking I may have enjoyed Joker equally however from an objective standpoint it is extremely plain to see it was the rightful winner of its Oscar for best picture and WITHOUT A DOUBT the most original.

Borrowed space, deceived wine, a moment of happiness, the most beautiful is not the villa courtyard but the family, the rich surface is glamorous and beautiful, behind the drug abuse, the children are rebellious and sick, the poor put down patience and expose the hypocrisy of the face, just like this Going into the room becomes falling to the bottom. Who's not a parasite? The human heart is complicated, human nature is difficult to ponder, and I hope that fantasy will become a reality ~ The Palme d'Or is deserved!","Apr 28, 2020"
8,Masterpiece,"This oscar winning movie of 2019 gives clear pictures of our society ,where unequal distribution and growth of wealth have resulted in rich becoming richer and poor becoming poorer. This movie is on class war which is shown very cleverly .Even small things are shown with fine details. There is not much action in this movie but whatever it is they seems to be real.The comedy has also been added to this movie and that too in different way.The film has been made horror but we hardly can realize it .it is build so well that we don't know what is going to happen next .Suddenly movie takes 360 turn which is very interesting. overall movie is great , the only problem is that it's in korean language but with english subtitle.","Apr 7, 2020"
8,upward taste,"The movie proves to us that the plot plays are great in expressing the social sufferings, and they are told in the form of banter. In the movie, the problem of Korean social class (the same theme as burning, which shows the serious problem of Korean social class) is designed as an ingenious story with strong dramatic tension and full of suspense. The title parasite is a metaphor, and the stone is also a metaphor. A lot of political background corners are used as embellishments, and a lot of lines can be highlighted as golden sentences.","Apr 6, 2020"

8,High ambition and downfall.,"First time in the history, a foreign movie got oscar and that is parasite 2019. There are some extraordinary characteristics which make this movie a unique one. One of the these exclusive traits is high ambition and downfall.

On the other hand, this will turn out really boring for those who just watch the plot not the mathaphore that has been put together. The main character (the son) has explicitely said the word of methapore at the beginning of the movie, if we take that and put it throughout the movie, this movie will turn out really briliant. I definitely watch this for the second time just to understand every detail.","May 25, 2020"

Through precise acting by the cast the movie imposingly justifies the desperation of the neglected. A well written story with imaginativeness of the highest quality. Excellent visual effects and use of colour tones to portray the decaying of the society's core. Excellent design of characters capturing many traits of personalities. There's alot to gather from this movie and what's truly interesting when it's viewers turn to decide who the real parasites of the society are.","Mar 5, 2023"
8,Good movie,"Gisaengchung is a really good film. I really liked the story and how the family is slowly taking control of the rich family. The methods to make fire the employees are really smart and realistic. Althought I don't think deserve all the prizes he had. It's a really good film, I can't deny it but it isn't incredible. The poor family is also really endearing so we can better dive in the movie and his atmosphere. The the plot twists are very surprising and unexpected (i won't spoil). And finally the end is also unexpected and really clever, but also a little bit disapointing. I recommend this movie.","Mar 20, 2020"
8,wonderful movie,"The biggest highlight of this movie is the symbolic meaning behind his plot. The family relies on ""excellent"" performance skills to mix into a high-income family and become a parasite life. Although the means are despicable, with deception, It is deceitful, but on the whole ""performing"" is very immersive for rich families. Until the emergence of another ""parasitic"" family, the whole movie entered a dark and bizarre plot, the final vicious murder, and finally the plot of concealed communication by the Morse code, people felt suffocated.","Apr 1, 2020"
8,Capitalism is same in every country. Chaotic. Thrill,So watched the Korean movie Parasite. It is about poor family conning their way up into a wealthy family and things just go wild as the mystery unfolds.The chains of class created by capitalism is felt same by everyone. This is what everyone connected to. The chaos we all thrive for is served well. The whole movie is the buildup for this and he has been able to do it in his own chaotic way! Chaos?!,"Mar 17, 2020"
8,The decay of capitalism is inevitable,"To be honest, the family 's three views and one word are difficult to solve. It 's really a problem. Like a parasite, the family sucks in others. Don't say it 's disgusting, even if it 's low. If something goes wrong, you still want to solve the problem by killing people. In the end, your father killed the little girl 's dad. At the end, he was still completely regretful. He did n't lose the little girl. Then this layer of class gaps and gaps that are determined by social status and money need not be portrayed. Such an explicit irony is only ironic. Such a direct description not only does not perfectly show the poverty at the bottom of this society. The destiny of the gap between cheap and social class seems to add to the picture, but it is indeed a masterpiece of the feature film.","Mar 19, 2020"
8,The poor and the rich are mirrored.,"The house is the main body, and all three families are parasites of the house.

The mobility of the three families did not affect the house. Class can be said to be eternal, and the falsehood of society is eternal. The film, just the fate, the social truth in the form of fable, to the audience","Mar 18, 2020"
8,Super big plot twist. Almost an entirely different movie in the second half of the movie. Amazing !,"Parasite is an instant all time classic. Like ""Breaking Bad"" it is pretty much perfect in every way...script, casting, lighting, locations, makeup and hair, music. Will be all all time great lists for years to come. Most important, a movie like this helps the world get over itself as far as fear of subtitles is concerned. Think of the GREAT movies that will be opened up for the great American movie-loving public once they learn to tolerate subs! Perfect movie-making, it's a rare treat...enjoy!","Mar 25, 2020"

8,The conflicts,"On one side is a flooded room and on the other is a birthday party. On one side is the icy and hard stadium and on the other is the luxurious soft back garden. Money is an iron, which irons everything. They scour the net, live in the basement, and do whatever they can to get a job. When you think they are miserable enough, the movie suddenly reverses: they are not the worst, they are even worse. If you are rich, there must be richer than you; if you are poor, there must be poorer than you. The gap between the rich and the poor is like countless walls that divide people into three, six, and nine. This wall, standing in the wind, the sun and the rain, stood still. The Park couple looked stupid, but they were still getting richer and richer; the Kim Ji-zee family was clever but couldn't stand up. You thought you could get a good job, get a good salary, and get rid of your poverty status. You can wash off the sweat of your clothes, but you can't wash off the smell of the basement that is already in the blood. You climbed ten or twenty floors, and you may have just reached someone's basement. They are bugs, so they have a hard life; they are bugs, so nothing kills them.","Mar 17, 2020"

8,Perfect balancing between humour and crime,"It's Korean movie , based on survival of poor family on one rich and dumb businessman. It starts with tutor who belongs to poor family and smartly he makes the room for other family members as well in rich family. Movie gets Dramatic turn when old maid came to know that these all tutor driver belongs to same family when owner went on vacation. 1st half is quite good and full of presense of mind and tricks, 2nd half turned violent . If you expect some happy ending kind stuff then The parasite will not for you.","Feb 28, 2020"
8,The other face of reality,"Parasite is a movie that has been recognized and given really good reviews, anyways to me it wasn't the best movie ever. This movie was different in the sense that it played with your mind having a story unpredictable. Parasite is also a reflect of society, our worst fear is ourselves and the system we have constructed. We are always trying to get more and more and sometimes we aren't able to see the risks until you loose it all. That's why I liked all the outcome that reflects what our reality is, anyways the result of all the problems was something not really convincing to me. The possibilities to get to that end are one in one million, so I think even a better ending would be too keep this real idea that things not always end up as we want. The movie in general was really well made, the way Bong Joon Ho thought about every scene and detail is surprising.","Feb 25, 2020"
8,A metaphorical masterpiece,"So, movie contains a good amount of metaphors.Color Scheme of movie creates a suspense and shot framing is perfect everytime. Clearly depicts a life of a poor family's life. Contains a good amount of humor and NSFW scenes present too.","Feb 24, 2020"
8,Enjoyable Satirical Drama,"Most people will be intrigued as to how this movie won so many awards before they even watch it. Most people won't watch as they can't be bothered with subtitles. It's worth it. A well constructed story of a family scheming to live off another family. It's fun as the story unravels with a comedy yet sinister fashion. Great acting all round with a decent script, remember its subtitled but you get used to that and its not that demanding to read and the acting being that good makes it very easy to follow. Parasite is a refreshingly different and keeps you watching with some twists and turns that make you wonder how its going to end. Its well worth a watch and you'll enjoy.","Nov 26, 2020"
8,"Good, but overrated and dangerous message","It's a very well-made movie. The third act is tumultuous, trying to mimic a sort of Taratino-esque atmosphere that works partly. I really don't see how this movie won the Oscar when Jordan Peele's ""Us"", a movie with VERY similar themes, but much more well put together, wasn't even nominated. The ""message"" of the film is rather evil and misinterpretable; we're talking about a country that only has the money to make this sort of cinema because economic liberalism built it from the disgrace it was in the past century. The poor family's father's reaction to his boss disliking his smell, in the privacy of his home, is ridiculous.","Jul 7, 2020"
8,Honest opinion,The story it self is kind of predictable but it is very eye opening and touching. The characters make you feel like they're real; for a second I forgot I was in a movie. I understand why it won best picture. The shooting of the film was AMAZING.,"Feb 21, 2020"
8,Excellent,"Story was very unpredictable and giving good messages. That line impressed me: ""she is kind because she is rich""","Feb 18, 2020"
8,"Strange, funny and artistic","It's easy to see why Parasite got so many Oscars. It's in that classic Oscar winning style of being quite artsy and something totally un-blockbuster like. These are always going to be movies that are enjoyable and have a great story to tell rather than just being about a feast of action for the eyes. Parasite has such a strange mix of humour and horror towards the end. Overall the biggest takeaway is the contrast between rich and poor. It takes you through such a stark contrast and the perceptions of both sides. The flood was a great example, for one family a bit of fun, for another you lose everything you own. In the end, we cannot assume that we would not behave in similar ways when we have had everything taken away from us and we are losing our lives. Quirky, but interesting.","Dec 18, 2020"
8,Oscar? Really ?,This is a great movie and exciting scenario except from the ending. The Oscars awards lost its reputation in my eyes. The movie definitely doesn't deserve an Oscar and if it's the opposite then I'm the cruelest critic ever!!!,"Mar 14, 2020"
8,The Most Important Movie in 2019?,"I finally went along with OSCAR hype and watched the 'Parasite' (just kidding, I was going to see it anyways, I just never managed to get into the theater in the summer when it was in the cinemas. I'm not quite sure did seeing the movie after all the award shower enhanced the viewing experience, or left me with shoulder shudder. I will not say that 'Parasite' is not worthy of all these awards, but considering all the hype - I expected something, I don't know, more. Do I think that the film is overrated, or underrated doesn't matter? What matters, is that 'Parasite' is a wonderful movie. I must give the highest praise to the actors. The story was intriguing with several layers, and it contained some unpredictable twists and turns along the way. I have a hard time to find perfect words to praise the cinematography - the camera (literally) danced with the actors and with the story. Yet, it was all so subtle that if you just didn't turn your attention to awe at the cinematography, you almost didn't notice it. Same thing with editing. The magnificent aspect was also the way the story was told - it started like absurdist comedy, then turned to quite spicy satire, then all of the sudden gory thriller and then ending this all with a nice touch of morale, but without preaching. The change in the atmosphere didn't ruin the pace or make the film lose its focus. The characters were clear, each one of them perfectly fleshed out. At least, the best original screenplay award is well earned.

Besides being visually poetical and masterfully acted, the movie raises some poignant questions. People praise how good of overview 'Parasite' gives on South-Korean society, but to be honest - all the 'First World' countries are dealing with the same problems. No matter which economical class we are, people ale too self-absorbed, that they don't see the faults in themselves - everything is someone else's fault. While different people struggling for the same goal, rather than becoming allies and work together, they start to compete, and that usually means, that both sides will lose (that is just philosophizing, it is not a spoiler).

Was it the most important film in 2019? Well, I don't know, because I haven't seen most of them, but 'Parasite' is most definitely a rare masterpiece that can be entertaining and what most important, thought-provoking at the same time.","Mar 5, 2020"
8,Pretty good movie,I saw this movie about a year ago when it came out in cinemas and I enjoyed it quite a lot. I think its a bit overrated but its still good and enjoyable. I would recommend people see this if they have not already.,"Oct 8, 2020"
8,Devastating Filmmaking,"With one of the most staggering turns in movie history, the stakes in what was already an extremely tense moment rose to an unprecedented level. The characters walk on such a fine line when trying to keep the other family fooled by their act that the film contains some of the most tense moments I have ever seen. The desperation and the lengths at which they go to left me in awe and made me question if their aim was still, if ever, worth it.

With a finely crafted script, true emotion, and some beautifully positioned shots, this film is unforgiving and left me completely emptied and speechless in what was one of the most affecting movies I have seen. Parasite will stick with me for a long time.","Feb 17, 2020"
8,Really good movie,"Really good movie, well directed and played by actors, story is also Excellent, it's showing the reality of our society, and mental behavior of different people of different stage.","Feb 10, 2020"
8,That everyone goes wild for this shows America's quality of movies,"Great watch, could watch again, and can recommend if you're okay with subtitles.

What in the world? Why was everyone SO HYPED about this? Yes its good, but its not even ""Get Out"" good.

We follow an awful family of financial parasites (the movie should have been called ""Parasites"", much more apt), and while I didn't necessarily see the ""twists"" coming, they were so natural that they weren't surprises so much as they were just things that made sense.

I don't think Americans are able to gauge good quality of entertainment (see any reality tv show). While this is good, it shouldn't have taken America by storm like it did. This should be a bar for movies to reach (and honestly it shouldn't be so hard to get on the same level as this movie: we just lack originality and substance over...explosions and punching).

The main thing that makes this movie good is that there are no heroes (from the very beginning, it is established that the protagonists are awful), but those with and those without, and it doesn't seem to matter how you get what you get as long as you get it.

And while Americans are going to go wild relating to wronging their peers to get by, the focus is on ""take from the rich"" so a crude lens is going to justify their actions when its still legally and morally wrong, but there is a capitalistic mindset that just sees the survival and the gains as a win.

This movie has some depth and substance to it that you don't normally see from America, and this is one that is worth the read.","Jun 12, 2020"
8,Enjoyable movie but acclaimed for the wrong reasons,"I have serious issues with this movie.

Not because it isn't incredibly well-made, acted etc. I've seen some bad reviews of it which I don't agree with, but I understand where they are coming from. Because at no point is the audience given even the slightest hint about why any of this is happening. Why are this rich family hiring an art tutor for their eight year old? They must have more money sense. Rich people are stupid. Look at this smart but poor family taking advantage, it's all good. Well no it isn't actually. Scamming is a massive issue in Korea. Voice-phishing, molka cams, car insurance scams are an absolute plague and they are, in many ways, uniquely korean issues.

But that isn't why this movie leaves a bad taste. At no point is it addressed why this family would need to be hiring tutors for their kids. This is a very Korean issue, and it isn't something that is exclusive to rich people. It is in fact the norm. It's just much easier when you're rich because no personal sacrifices need to be made. Maths tutors for 4 year olds. Piano teachers. Ballet lessons. Learning 3 or 4 languages. This actually happens. Yes at 4 years old. So an art tutor for an 8 year old really isn't anything to bat an eyelid about if you live in Korea. Which is why most young Koreans would do anything to live in Europe or the US, it's just a constant grind every single day.

This isn't a film about inequality. In fact, Korea is well down the list of most unequal societies. Elderly poverty is a big problem in Korea. Inequality is not. Seoul is just a city, like London or New York or San Francisco that has very expensive districts and houses/apartments. But unlike those other cities, schooling is a large part of the reason for that. Everything comes back to education yet here we are blaming it on 'inequality'. It's fashionable of course. There's always something with the best picture oscar these past few years.

Anyway, it's good to see a Korean movie doing so well. I would rather it have been Old Boy winning the big awards but I have no issue with this kind of entertaining fluff winning awards. Korea deserves recognition as they are producing some fantastic TV and films.","Feb 12, 2020"

8,"Sad, but good story","It's not what I expected the ending. But, the nature of humankind to survive, to thrive drive is seen in this movie. But the ending, it was unexpected; it's a pretty surprising ending. This movie could be a good discussion of reality, trust and the need for work.","Apr 1, 2020"
8,A good movie even with subtitles,"This was a very good movie even though I had to read subtitles. I enjoyed it and found the movie entertaining with a message. However, I did find the second part of the movie a little rushed. But, the movie is worth watching.","Feb 19, 2020"

8,"Parasite was an interesting enough piece of work that probably earned its Best Picture Oscar. It's certainly not conventional, I'll tell you that!","Since it won the Oscar for Best Picture, Mom and I were curious about watching this Korean film and we finally did today after I checked this out from the library. The verdict: It's interesting how the picture goes to various places concerning the poor family being employed by the rich one and then also a surprise concerning an eventual former employee of the rich family with a secret... Mom wasn't so enamored of the story because it didn't have a happy ending and I, well, I admire the way it was written, performed, and filmed but, yeah, I didn't love it. But it's a unique enough piece of work so that's something of a recommendation...","Oct 14, 2020"

It didn't feel forced or silly .. it was powerful .. edge of your seat .. wanting to know what happens next all at the same time causing you to look introspectively within yourself in situations where you are the ""parasite "" or someone is to you .

Great acting .. great plot .. great twists . Worth the time . Honestly if I went in with lower expectations it would have been a 9 I was just expecting so much it was hard to surpass that .. but would highly recommend to anyone .","Feb 1, 2020"

8,It's a good watch,"I am not a movie enthusiast, to be frank. Have seen some of the good movies. Most of them were really very good. Watched this one after it had won oscars and created a lot of buzz. I hate to say this but i couldn't agree with most of the audiences here. I think it is overrated. I can't explain why. Well, not now. May be sometimes later. But, yeah it is overrated. Its a good one time watch though. Can't recommend to anyone i can think of right now. Sorry.","Apr 25, 2020"
8,Successful and rare Story,"This film finally has an action that has never existed before. And that's exactly the best thing about the film. A thriller story between rich and poor that is pretty well written.

As such, I personally found the staging to be rather standard. But the end is worth it in my opinion. The film is rather calm, but the end is all the more shocking and blatant. The acting is solid. The poor family is easy to find, even though it embodies evil. The development of family behavior is scary.

If you know the core of the story at the end, the film title makes a very good sense. In my opinion, Parasite wasn't the best film of the year. But worth seeing. Mostly because of the story.","Jul 26, 2020"
8,Probably better if you go into it without massive expectations,"First I'd like to say that I really liked this movie. It had a plot that instantly drew me in and characters that were easy to root for. It told a difficult tale about class struggle without turning the main characters into 2-dimensional heroes. It even ended with an unexpected intensity that I seriously doubt anyone saw coming.

All of that said, it underwhelmed me. It repeated things over and over again, which was a plot device, but made some parts really drag. Moreover, the film's failure to assign winners and losers in its conclusion made it intriguing, but also left each character unlikeable- and when all the characters end up being unlikeable, it kind of leaves you feeling like the time you just invested was somewhat meaningless. I probably wouldn't feel that way if I had gone into it with no expectations- I may only focus on the good, but unfortunately I only watched it after everyone said it was the best film of the year and after it became the first foreign film to win best picture at the Oscars.

I can only pass along my own, subjective experience, and that was it. 🤷‍♂️","Feb 16, 2020"
8,Tragedy,"Who is the antagonist? This question popped into my head after I finished Bong Joon Ho's Parasite and as I read some snippets from Bong himself. He consistently refers to the film as a tragedy, and, as I wondered who the antagonist was, I remembered that in Greek tragedy, the fall of the hero always stems from a flaw within themselves. Then the answer clicked. The antagonists are the Kims.

So, the Kims are a poor family of four, struggling to make a living in Seoul and conning their way into life's niceties. In the opening scene, we see them clamor up to the corner of their bathroom (where their toilet is elevated above the rest of the room) to steal wifi after their upstairs neighbors put a password on theirs. The son, Dong Ik, gets an offer from a friend to cover for him as an English tutor to a daughter of a wealthy family. Dong Ik uses his position to get one for his sister as an art teacher/therapist for the younger child, a position driving the patriarch for his father, and the position of housekeeper for his mother. The first two positions are simply open and require nothing more than convincing the mother of the house to give them a shot, but the house already has a driver and a housekeeper. And that is where the con takes another level.

Ki Jung leaves her underwear in the car when the driver drives her home, creating the impression, when the patriarch finds them, that the driver was having sex with women in his car. He gets let go, replaced by Ki Taek, Dong Ik's father. To get rid of the housekeeper requires more planning, since she had been with the house from the house's previous owner. They end up having to take extreme measures which include convincing the mother of the house that the housekeeper has tuberculosis and triggering the housekeeper's life-threatening allergy to peach fuzz. The Kims are not good people. They're deceptive, cruel, and dishonest.

The Parks, on the other hand, are a mixture of detached, thoughtless, and unfeeling. They're not really good people either. They dismiss the driver without asking him about the underwear, fully believing the worst of him based on a single piece of evidence while discounting all the time they have spent with him. They cast off the housekeeper without even asking her if she actually as tuberculosis.

The key is that both groups are their own destructive forces. It's hard to get into how that manifests late in the film (essentially past the halfway point) without digging into spoilers, so I'll speak in generalities. It's the Kim's duplicitousness that gets them into the situation that undoes them. It's their lies that keep them from finding solutions that will actually work. On the other side is the Parks whose thoughtlessness and lack of feeling brought in the destructive force into their homes to begin with. There are no heroes or villains in this story, only flawed people who can't grow.

The movie is filled with imagery as well. From the scholar's rock that Dong Ik carries around, meant as a symbol for wealth, to the constant vertical motion of the characters. There's a large sequence where a torrential downpour hits the city and the Kims, after having been trapped in the Park's house because of their presumption that the richer family would be out of town all night, run down the hills of Seoul to their half-underground dwelling that's been filled with water, the toilet spewing a black substance because of the messed up pressure. The Kims left their window open that allowed the water in. Would they have left it open if they hadn't spent the night at the Parks' residence? The rain isn't the fault of either the Parks or the Kims, but it affects both families very differently. Atop their hill in their mansion, the Parks simply watch it from their window, appreciating the aesthetics. The Kims get wiped out and end up abandoning their home to sleep on the floor of a local gym along with the others who were displaced.

It's an interesting and highly entertaining look into the class differences present in South Korea. It's alternatively extremely funny, horrifying, and even touching. It can be all three in seconds, and it ends up working because the tone never really jumps. It's evenly and expertly filmed with an eye towards black comedy and tragedy mixed into one package.","May 5, 2020"
8,A must watch,"I hadn't read a lot about this film before watching it, so I didn't know what to expect. All I knew is it had won a lot of awards and was talked about for a long time.

A film focused around a poor family who trick a highly wealthy family into hiring them for their skills.

I had no idea where this film was going to go, there was so many different twists changing things up. It's a brilliant film, and the actors all did so well. If I had to fault anything, it would be that I didn't really see a tight family connection between the poor family.","Mar 17, 2020"
8,"Very Good Movie, Very Over-Hyped","This movie is very good, but watching it for the first time several years after it was very popular and all over the news, it's obvious that it was highly over-hyped at the time it was released.

The director is not a genius. The story is not brilliant. The actors/actresses were not wonderful.

The director focuses the movie on modern issues with class that we all relate to. You have sympathy for everyone in the movie, from the rich people to the poor. The story isn't exactly believable, but it works to get the point across. The actors and actresses all did well, but to say that much of the acting ranges from wooden to incredible exaggeration is an understatement.

So, I felt plenty of emotion watching this movie, and I felt strongly for everyone in it. But, to say that this made me see or feel anything I've never seen or felt before is as exaggerated as some of the hype about this movie.

I am not ""born again"" because I was witness to this movie, but it makes you think and reflect on different people that these people remind you of in the real world. Maybe if you are very much like any of the pathetic characters in this movie, and believe me, every one of them is absolutely pathetic, then watching this movie may be like an earth shattering revelation.

But, for the vast majority of us who live a very tamped-down version of the existence of one or more of these characters, watching this movie is just a bit like looking in a mirror, causing you to pause and think about yourself and others. And that is always very good. Not great, but very good.","Sep 3, 2022"

8,Mixed emotions,"My first korean movie, and was a great surprise; No one can say this is not a good movie, but the ending and the director explanation about the themes is very disappointing. It's supposed to be another anti capitalism movie, but they failed miserably, only the leftists will relate with the parasite family.","Jun 22, 2020"
8,"Not My Best Picture, but a Great Picture","Bong Joon-Ho delivers greatness with this exploration of class warfare in South Korea.

What I love most about this film is how the director does not preach to us a trite message about greed, envy, and inequality. In fact, neither the rich nor the poor in this film are treated like demons or saints - just people intersecting from their opposite ends of the social spectrum and all the chaos that comes with it.

Mid-way, the film takes a crazy turn that you do not see coming and it becomes something else entirely. I will not give it away, but Bong Joon-Ho certainly knows how to keep the audience interested in what could have been a low-hanging fruit story about ""social justice.""","Mar 26, 2023"
8,Bravo,"Captivating, thrilling, appalling, stomach wrenching. These are words used to describe Bong Joon Ho's Parasite. At first a seemingly witty and somewhat-vulgar comedy, it slowly evolves into something much more. The movie is in Korean with English subtitles. While some subtle cultural differences are noticeable, this movie can be enjoyed by Korean and American audiences alike.

The movie centers around the lower-class Kim family, consisting of a man and a woman and their young-adult son and daughter. In the beginning, they are just scraping by, assembling pizza boxes for meager pay and living out of a less-than-desirable underground apartment in a run-down neighborhood of urban sprawl. Then one day, their fate changes: the son's friend, who is about to go overseas to study, hands off to him his job working as an English tutor for the high-school aged daughter of the wealthy upper-class Park family. The Parks reside in a remarkably modern house designed by a well-renowned Korean architect. Think the Frank Lloyd Wright of Korea. The house is gated and surrounded by beautiful luscious greenery: a far cry from the run-down apartment of the Kims. The Park family closely resembles the Kims in its composition: a husband, a wife, a son, and a daughter. However, the children are much younger. The young Kim, upon providing a falsified college transcript, is hired on the spot by the remarkably naive lady of house.The house goes on to become the main setting for the rest of the rollercoaster ride that is Parasite.

One-by-one, through their crafty use of deception and by playing a few dirty tricks, the rest of the family succeeds in invading their way into employment in the extravagant Kim household. The family rejoices in its new circumstances, having made this elegant house their sanctuary and having turned their financial situation around by milking the cash cow of the Park family. However, this sense of wealth and prosperity proves to be ephemeral as the dark secret of the house soon-after is revealed in a torrential whirlwind of events.

This movie made me somewhat envious as to the Kim family's unity. My brothers, parents, and I have never been as close to each other as to what I witnessed in this movie. Even if the motivations of the Kims are ill-willed, I couldn't help but to empathize with the family. Their crude behavior is quite entertaining as well. From my own experience, I have never had to face poverty in the way that they did. Perhaps because of this, my family is not as close to each other as theirs.

The inequality between upper and lower social classes is a major recurring theme throughout the movie. While at times a bit over-dramatic in its stark contrasts, the movie's cinematography is ingenious through its use of space. It is quite clear that the Park family's house is unnecessarily large, but it never feels quite as luxurious or over-the-top as a mansion. This concept of space lends itself to another major factor: the Park family's socioeconomic privilege and inherent disregard towards people of the lower-class, especially observable through the actions and mannerisms of Mr. Kim. This is a pertinent and powerful theme which makes the movie all the more interesting and intriguing. Similar themes can be observed in Warner Bros. and Todd Phillips' recent box-office smash-hit Joker. Sadly, there will always be the ""haves"" and the ""have-nots,"" for better or for worse, and discussion regarding the capitalist system in which the people of South Korea and we in the U.S. reside could go on for days.

The film's soundtrack is very tasteful. The beginning section of the film is accompanied by pleasant percussive sounds. As the plot thickens, the music grows in intensity, mirroring the looming atmosphere of uncertainty. Stringed instruments such as violins and cellos become much more prominent and are cleverly implemented to express sentiments of unease and for a peculiar ominous effect.

All in all, Parasite is a very thought-provoking journey which takes the viewer to unexpected places. As a sociological commentary which will surely be looked at differently by different people, this film may not be particularly agreeable with everyone who views it. I do not wish to spoil anything, but I will say this: it is not for the faint of heart. This film is an accomplishment in the international Korean film industry, and its commercial success will hopefully lead to more Korean movie-screenings in U.S. movie theaters. I hope the movie will make people here who were not interested in learning Korean (or any other foreign language, for that matter) more motivated to embrace the amazing and fruitful process of learning a new language. Above all, I am not necessarily aware of anything I wasn't already aware of after having watched this movie, and I don't believe it to have changed me or my beliefs. It also leaves a few unanswered questions. Overall, it was an indulgent, aesthetically pleasing, and even at times surreal experience. I would definitely watch it again, although it might not be my first choice.","Nov 3, 2019"
8,Strongly Directed by Bong Joon-Ho,"There are more strong film makers in this world than are just sitting in traditionally English-speaking Countries (like the U.S./England). One of the strongest - and a Director that I will watch WHATEVER he is Directing - is South Korean auteur Bong Joon-Hoo. His previous efforts (THE HOST, OKJA, SNOWPIERCER, amongst others) were all led by intriguing stories, interesting people and strong visual imagery, so I was very excited for his newest effort, PARASITE. I purposely did not find out too much about this film, for I wanted to be surprised by what was unfolding in front of me.

And...I was rewarded, greatly by another intriguing story with interesting people and strong visual imagery.

In Korean, with English subtitles, PARASITE follows a lower class Korean family that go to work for a high class Korean family and brings us on a journey for BOTH families. And that's all I'm going to say about it, for to reveal anything else would be to spoil the surprises along the way.

But, as is often the case with these types of stories, it is the journey, not the destination that is the treat of this film. Bong Joon-Ho regular Kang-ho Song stars as the Patriarch of the lower class family who, seemingly, is lazy and allergic to ""work"", but that is not really the case. Woo-sik Choi is the son of the lower class family that connects with the daughter of the higher class family and Hye-jin Jang is the matriarch of the lower class family and they both bring sensitivity and strength to their roles. But for me, the real star of this film is So-dam Park as the daughter of this family who turns out to be the heart and the brains of the operation.

Director Bong Joon-Ho brings his usual flair to the proceedings, not letting his camera shy away from the seemy underbelly of this society, but not lingering on it either, moving the surprising plot along at a fast (enough) pace to keep you guessing throughout. I see a lot of films, so when I run across a plot that I couldn't tell what was going to come next, it is satisfying.

And, satisfying this film is. Some are calling it an ""Oscar Contender"" and I don't think I would go quite that far - the film does drag a bit in the middle. But, if you can handle reading the subtitles, you'll be entertained indeed by the fervent mind of one of the better Directors working in film today.

Interesting and insightful about Korean culture and disparities in living conditions, and the hopes and aspirations of all but felt something was missing. I read that Bong Joon-ho relied on intensive story boarding and this film did feel like enacted somewhat in segments.

I expected a lot more from a film with such a buzz around it and four Oscars, two of them for ""best Director"" and ""best film"". the idea and message are clear, but I'm only talking about the first hour of the movie. somewhere in the middle of the story begins to gain momentum incomprehensible to me, and the genre of the film changes in the opposite direction. the ending of the film is no less strange. apparently, these are the features of South Korean cinema that I could not understand, alas. I put this film 8/10 and believe that it received this rating from me as undeservedly as its 4 Oscars.. .","Feb 11, 2020"
8,Amazing!,"One of the best films! The way this movie takes you in the history is just the right way, everything connects perfectly. Well written and there is no notable mistakes. If you like thrillers and seen other things that American films this is the movie. One of the best movies in 2019","Jan 30, 2020"
8,Interesting Film,"Enjoyed this film, funny yet scary and thought provoking, would recommend to anyone","Nov 27, 2019"
8,What a movie!!!,"The plot starts as a comedy by taking advantage of a gullible rich lady and slowly creeps into the harsh truth of haves and have not. The climax leaves a strange impact on - ""Is it even possible to attain the status of a good earning life style for such a family in honest ways?"". One of the masterpiece from Korean films. A worthy watch that keeps you entertained!!","Feb 9, 2020"
8,Screenplay is excellent!,This is a story of a poor family who decides to wage war on many fronts. There are some moments that will tug at your heartstrings and leave you in shock.,"Apr 12, 2020"
8,A little hard to follow but good,"Parasite is probably the most interesting vol I've seen this year. It was a little hard to follow but it's worth the watch, even with subtitles. Not sure I understood the end.","Jun 16, 2020"
8,Korean phenomen,"I watched this film after the latest Oscar ceremony but I didn't expect a lot from this film. So, I was really surprised. Firstly, the story is really interesting, it seems very simple but you will be a little bit shocked after middle of the film. The plot has some good twisted moments. Secondly, all cast showed the great performance, I believed them. Thirdly, I want to line cameraman's work, the frames looks awesome. I think that some scenes are too long, it's a reason why I didn't rate it more than 8. So, it's wonderful film about our society, family values and, at the end, love.","Apr 8, 2020"
8,Interesting movie to say the least!,"I watched the movie knowing how much praised it was, so the expectations were pretty high. I really liked the 1st half of the movie, the one establishing the whole ""deception"" situation . It was very smart and had 100% of my attention drawn to it. I consider the moment when the family sits at the living room and the doorbell rings a chasing point for both the plot and my overall view of the movie. It turned really weird really fast, with some small plot-holes (as of my own perception). I'd give a 9,5 to the 1st half of the movie, to the other half probably a 7. Still, decent movie overall, good acting, interesting idea, nice music and picture...it deserved the oscars it received, no doubt about that. And cinema is indeed a nice way to learn the culture of each country through the stories that are being told every time. I mostly watch European and American movies, so it was very interesting watching a Korean movie, and i did pick up some traces of their culture. Stonks!!!","May 31, 2020"
8,"Interesting film, but not the best film of 2019","I liked the movie, but it's not the best of 2019 !!! In my opinion 1917 should have won the Oscar for best film. But this is a good and interesting film.","Jun 21, 2020"
8,Not all families are perfect.,"From start to finish, Parasite is a malignant joy with a Machiavellian sense of mischief. It demonstrates Bong reveling in his Hitchcockian command of somewhat Buuelian material. The plot is both meticulously realized and uniquely Korean. Export potential are promising, as are remake opportunities. The film's most daring move is to make a picture in which all of the characters are openly unfeeling.

Everyone's all-out self-serving nastiness is supported by a scathing view of South Korea's haves and have-nots. A cast in peak character drives itself into increasingly ridiculous and cruel situations.","Dec 24, 2021"
8,Respekt,"Very funny movie, fast paced, nice aesthetics relatable plot","Sep 30, 2019"
8,"original, taking the absurd to reality- a story of desperation","The first 1/4, 1/3 was slow- but knowing it won best picture I continued with expectation. Knowing this was required to set up what follows. I don't agree that the characters are inconsistent, they are multi-dimensional. as to the violence, less than many others with less artistic merit. It is a kind of tragedy born out of desperation. Bad people or just desperate to survive. It takes the absurd, and brings it to reality in a credible way, step by step. Dreams of future success out of misery and poverty. Wrong decisions, sure. some surprises. I think it takes an unexpected course, amking the absurd seem plausible, almost destiny.

It's an interesting, original plot. and any violence is artistically justified, I think. And frankly these days, I've seen worse (usually won't watch) with less artistic merit. 8 stars (4 out of 5) is a great film- is it a masterpiece. I am not sure. Is it the best film of the year. I am not sure. good casting, which is important- good script, good director very solid film making","Jul 9, 2020"
8,Hidden politics. But a very good movie,"I wonder if this movie/story would've gotten an Oscar if it was made in Hollywood and in English. Surely had it been done in Hollywood it would've been just another well made thriller drama movie / very ""Talented Mr. Ripley"" like.

Don't get me wrong, it's a very well done and interesting film with a strong agenda. But imo should've been just a Foreign language award. Perhaps there were no stronger candidates this year from Hollywood that show life. And Parasite showed life and disparity in life really well. Put any country as a setting for this film and the story would still stick.","Feb 12, 2020"
8,There are two types of people.,Wonderful foreign movie I've watched this year but doubt I can rewatch cuz of how I cringed for the family the whole time.,"Dec 30, 2019"
8,two stories in one,"Beautifully filmed and acted! One family inserts itself into another, and neither will be the same again. And the way they address the socioeconomic disparities through the use of smell is really interesting. I didn't love the ending, but the rest was thoroughly engaging!","Aug 1, 2020"
8,Brilliant for bother the thinkers and those that simply want to be entertained,"Parasite has received rave reviews, it appears that no one is willing to say anything against it. I thought it was fantastically enjoyable if you want to just simply follow the plot - full of tension and fully fledged characters. There is also an entire other layer that one can see the film through though, so this appeases the thinking crowd too. I must admit that I thought the second layer was not always clear about what it was trying to say. However it is clearly one of those films which is MEANT to raise more questions than it does answers and that is fine (though can be frustrating for some). Ultimately it is one of those films that is difficult to mark down from a technical or artisitic or even entertainment standpoint. However, it has to be said that it is not hugely emotionally affecting. And this is not necessary a fault. But in my opinion for a film to be 10/10, despite its technical brilliance, has to be emotionally affecting and really make you feel something and teach you more about yourself and other humans around you. Parasite doesn't quite do this which stops it form being in my list of favourite films. But I fully respect it is an excellent movie (entertainment) and also an excellent film (art).","Nov 12, 2021"
8,Korean movie,"An interesting and unusual plot. Excellent atmosphere. The film shows the hypocrisy and ingratitude of people. I also liked that there is no cliche in the film, such as: The rich - evil, greedy, cold-blooded and smug or The poor - kind, brave and sensitive. The biggest minus is the ending. I expected something more interesting and unusual. The end was predictable.","Jan 10, 2020"
8,Para Para... Parasite!,"I wish I could hop in a DeLorean Phone Booth and travel back in time. Not all that long ago, just to a place before Parasite became ubiquitous with greatness. It's my own fault, coming to it late. At first, I didn't get to it because of life, then I avoided it because of the hype, then I felt like I needed to wait till the right moment to properly enjoy it but the hype never quite died down, did it?

Watching this now, I can't say a bad thing about it. It's brilliantly shot, everything tracks and makes sense on the screen. The story is fascinating and feels fresh and different. The acting is all spot on, even managing to make characters that really shouldn't be likable... Likable. The metaphors laid out are relevant and neither feel like they are assaulting you or like you need an advance degree in film theory to understand. It's all good stuff.

So why don't I love this movie? I liked it. I did. But I wanted to come away from it with a sense of awe. I wanted to feel the masterpiece that is Parasite, like the rest of the world seems to have felt it. Instead, I feel like it's good, really good even, but I don't quite get the hype. If I had to put my finger on it, I'd say it's probably because I don't connect with the characters all that much, save for one. Everyone else here felt pretty basic to me.

I absolutely plan to watch this again. I want to uncover what's here, I want to see what everyone else sees in it. As of right now though, definitely haver to put Snowpiercer above this one, in my own personal preference rankings.","Sep 25, 2023"
8,Solid movie,Unique movie for me. It's a bunch of genres in one sorta. I like how a lot of things in the beginning came back around later in the film.,"Feb 16, 2020"
8,Near perfect,One that will leave you thinking One that will leave you thinking,"Dec 28, 2019"
8,Glad this movie was recognized by the academy.,I don't watch many non-english language films but I think Parasite is worthy of worldwide recognition for being an exceptional film. Although I don't see it as a masterpiece I think there are a lot of high-level elements of filmmaking in this. The plot seems simple enough but there is a lot of depth in the writing and storytelling to warrant multiple viewings. The acting is great as well as the direction but I'm always feeling like I'm missing the full experience when subtitles don't convey the subtleties of the language and cultural references. But that just goes with the territory if you happen to be from a foreign country. 8/10,"Feb 8, 2020"
8,Parasite Is An Upper Class Movie,"Parasite is a fantastic movie that features sympathetic, yet morally gray characters and their plight to earn enough money to live. Despite the awful things the characters do, you feel for each and every one of them thanks to the fantastic writing and acting. The humour is also fantastic and always lands. Seriously, despite being a drama, Parasite is one of the funniest movies I've seen all year. However, the reason why I can't say that Parasite is one of 2019's best movies is the ending. The ending is so anticlimactic, disappointing and dissatisfying. It didn't feel like that was what the film was building towards at all. However, I still recommend Parasite as it's mostly a fantastic experience that I just wish had a stronger conclusion.","Feb 8, 2020"

8,brilliant cinema,"Greetings again from the darkness. At least once per year, a movie really hits a sweet spot ... something that is fun to watch and not really like anything we've previously seen. Korean filmmaker Bong Joon Ho's latest film is this year's cinematic surprise. It's filled with interesting characters, social commentary, a unique setting, a creative and twisty story, and enough tension that we are left stunned as the end credits roll. There have already been a few excellent movies this year, and this is surely to be a memorable addition to the best of 2019.

We first meet the Kims, a family in poverty living in near-squalor in a basement level apartment with one small window. That window is at street level and allows a bit of natural light to leak in, and also provides a too-clear view of drunks targeting the window as they relieve themselves. The family keeps the window open for free fumigation as the city sprayers drive past, in hopes that it will get rid of the pesky stink bug infestation (yes, there is symmetry to this later in the story). The Kim family consists of Dad (Kang-ho Song), Mother (Hye-jin Jang), teenage son Kevin/Ki-woo (Woo-sik Choi) and 20-something daughter Jessica/Ki-jung (So-dam Park), and they react strongly when they lose ""free hi-fi"" access from a neighbor's system. The family seems to make just enough money for their next meal despite somehow underperforming at their family job of folding pizza boxes for a local vendor.

Fortunes begin to change for the Kims when one of Kevin's friends ask him to take over tutoring a teenage girl for a wealthy family in town. This sets off an ingenious and sometimes quite funny chain of events that result in all four Kim family members working in some capacity for the Parks, the aforementioned wealthy family. The Park's home was designed by a famous architect and it is a stunning modern hillside home with lush garden and a window that stands in stark contrast to that little window in the Kim's city apartment. Mr. Park (Sun-kyun Lee) is a 1% tech titan married to a high-strung woman who is an eternally anxious and over-matched mom (a fantastic Yeo-jeong Jo). Their two kids are lustful teenage daughter Da-hye (Ji-so Jung) and hyperactive young son Da-song (Hyun-jun Jung).

It's fascinating to watch how this family of schemers infiltrates this gullible and vulnerable upper class home, and how they so are easily trusted thanks to photoshop skills, Google, and a street-wise understanding of how to read people. The script, co-written by the director and Han Jin Won, explores the co-dependency as the rich depend on the poor for service work, and the poor depend on the rich for jobs and a living wage. Given the film's title, we soon realize that a ""host"" may have more than one parasite at any time ... something that plays out in what has to be the wildest film twist of the year, thanks to an all-out performance from Jeong-eun Lee as the Park's long-time housekeeper.

The social and class commentaries are spread throughout, and in addition to the window comparisons, you'll also notice that the walk is uphill to the Parks' home and downhill (and flood-risky) to the Kim's apartment. There are multiple layers within the stories and within the individual characters. What begins as a devastating social satire morphs into a wild and crazy time of violence ... without losing its general theme. A comedy of familial con artists bursts into a violent class thriller - the price to pay for unearned comfort. The film is not just unpredictable, it smacks us with a jarring twist.

Bong Joon Ho has become a well-respected filmmaker for his previous work: THE HOST 2006, MOTHER 2009, SNOWPIERCER 2013, and OKJA 2017. This latest elevates him to a whole new level. The film is darkly humorous and unpredictable, with excellent performances throughout. It's also quite something to look at. Cinematographer Kyung-pyo Hong works his magic, and it should be noted that the Park's home is a complete set built solely for the film. I challenge you to notice this - I sure couldn't tell. The film won the 2019 Palme d'Or at Cannes Film Festival, and it is likely headed for many more accolades.","Nov 8, 2019"
8,Won Direction,"The Best Picture win for ""Parasite"" finally convinced some local cinemas to me to give it a whirl. Though I enjoyed it, I'm not sure I know genuinely know enough about South Korea class systems to be sure that I fully understood it. (Also, I apologise in advance for butchering South Korean Nomenclature in the next paragraph)

Kim Ki-Woo (Woo-sik Choi) lives in a subterranean apartment with his family. One day, he is offered the chance to tutor English to Park Da-Hye (Jung Ji-So) the daughter of a wealthy family. Spying the opportunity to exploit the family, Ki-Woo brings in his sister Kim Ki-Jung (Park So-dam) as art tutor to Da-Hye's younger brother. His father, Kim Ki-taek (Song Kang-ho) replaces the family's chauffer and most importantly, his mother, Park Chung-sook (Jang Hye-Jin) replaces Gook Moon-gwang (Lee Jung-eun) as the families trusted housekeeper. All is going well for the Kim family, until one night when the Parks are away - the former housekeeper returns and requests access to the basement, to collect something she's left behind.

I enjoyed ""Parasite"" a lot. The performances are great. Kim Ki-taek is probably the standout but there really is nobody who lets the film down. The direction and cinematography are excellent. I enjoyed the story, and particular, not knowing exactly where the film was going to go. I'd seen ""The Host"" before, so I know that Boon Joon-Ho is capable of taking his films into B-Movie territory so I had all sorts of potential horror/science fiction plots in mind. I don't feel like the film suffered in the second half although I accept that for some the switch from a confidence trickster movie to more of a revenge thriller might be a bit too much for some.

My problem was that I really don't know much about how South Korean society works. I'm assuming that he film is parable about the tiered levels of class and money in Korea. That the ""Parasite"" of the title can be considered both as the Kim family scamming money from the Parks, and the Parks living of the labour of their lower class employees. But again, I feel like I'm guessing this, rather than being sure.

That doesn't really affect my appreciation though of an excellent film and a worthy best picture winner this year.","Mar 4, 2020"
8,Wow!,"That was my reaction. Parasite starts as a sardonic black comedy about the relations between a poor family and a rich one in present day Seoul before veering off in an entirely unexpected, much darker, almost surreal direction.

The protagonists are the impoverished Kim family. Dad is a Micawber like optimistic fatalist, who has failed at numerous jobs but always expects something to turn up. Mom is solid and practical, a one-time high school track star, who keeps things together. The mid-20s daughter and college-age son are smart, quick, glib and nervy, willing to do whatever it takes, but they don't seem to have found their footing. They don't always agree, but they stick together.

The Kims live in a cramped, squalid basement apartment in the kind of neighborhood where drunks piss in the street. The scrape up a little money folding boxes for neighborhood pizzeria, none too competently. As we meet them, they have just lost free wi-fi because the neighbor upstairs has passworded her router. Dad advises the kids to hold their phones up and move around the apartment to see if they can catch a signal. They do, up on the ledge where the toilet sits. That's Dad's strategy for life in a nutshell.

Deliverance arrives in the form of Son's high school buddy Min, now in college. Min has a gig tutoring English to the 15 year old daughter of a very rich family. He's going to study abroad for a year, and he wants Son to hold his place till he gets back. Min intends to start dating the girl when she's old enough, and he figures Son will be a harmless substitute. Son did well on the English part of the college entrance exam, and Min assures him that he can bs his way through.

The rich family, named Park, live in a gorgeous, spacious modern mansion on a hill, formerly the home of a renowned modern architect who has since moved on to bigger things in Paris. The father is the kind of Korean global businessman who has been the subject of an admiring profile in the New York Times. Mrs. Park is described by Min as ""slow,"" which isn't quite right. She's an oblivious but nice lady, more ornamental than useful, who depends on a middle aged housekeeper and who dotes on and spoils her hyperactive 8 year old son. You might call her street dumb. The same is true of her husband, who knows his way around business but is not as worldly wise as he thinks he is.

The Parks are insulated from the realities of everyday life by a thick cushion of money, and they think the world works the way it's supposed to. Park is always concerned that the family servants ""don't cross the line"" into familiarity. He and his wife assume that anything American is automatically first class and, to show their sophistication, they pepper their Korean conversation with scraps of English the way Miss Piggy uses French.

With the help of a diploma forged by Daughter Kim on Photoshop, Son aces his interview with Mrs. Park and gets hired to give English lessons 2 or 3 afternoons a week. In short order, he and the girl are also making out when Mom's back is turned. Son sees the boy's weird paintings pinned up on the fridge. He suggests to Mrs. Park that the boy could use art therapy and that he just happens to know an American trained art therapist. Mrs. Park swallows the bait, Daughter Kim bluffs her way through the interview with a combination of arrogance and art therapy buzz words she's picked up on the internet, and in short order she's having regular sessions with the little boy. Now that they're through the Parks' gate, the Kim kids manipulate things so that the chauffeur gets fired and is replaced by Dad, and the housekeeper gets fired and is replaced by Mom. They never let on that they're all related. The Parks don't have a clue. When the little boy notices that the new driver smells just like his art teacher, Mr. Park brushes it off because all the people who ride the subway smell the same.""

At the halfway point, this has just been an amusing and quite enjoyable story of the clever, scrappy poor putting one over on the clueless, entitled rich. The Kims are making a very good living off the Parks and eating better than they have in a long time. Of course we know that the Kims will somehow screw up this honeypot and be threatened with discovery and disaster. Things do spiral out of control, but in a completely unexpected way. I can't say how without a major spoiler; let's just say that the Park mansion conceals some extraordinary secrets and that the injuries that the Kims have inflicted come back to haunt them. Their struggle to stave off detection starts as slapstick but gets more and more desperate, and it builds to a climax that you don't see coming but is completely foreshadowed and leaves you wrung out. Definitely worth it.

One sidelight for American viewers. Mr. Kim and one other character have each gone broke in the ""Taiwanese Cake"" business. I googled that. It turns out that there is a pattern in South Korean life of fads giving rise to a large number number of opportunistic but undercapitalized small businesses that fail when the fad runs its course. Taiwanese Cake was one of them, the equivalent of the US cupcake fad of 10 years ago.","Nov 15, 2019"
8,Parasite,"A poor street savvy family trick their way into taking on various roles working for a very rich family. The con works well until an unexpected turn of events leaves them in danger of being found out.

Extraordinarily absorbing film which manages to combine societal messages with high drama and laugh out loud comedy. All the characters in both families are a pleasure to be with - there are no villains here - and you just sit back and enjoy a well scripted journey in the certain knowledge that it's going to end in tears. The sets and the set pieces (the storm, the piece under the table etc) are superbly structured and the main house begins to feel like a genuine home. A lingering, audacious masterpiece","Feb 15, 2020"
8,Excellent film,"I would not rate this as the ""Best Movie of the Century "" like some hyperbolic reviewers. But. It is excellent and very well done. The story keeps you engaged throughout. I would rate even higher, but I thought the ending did not live up to the quality of the story which led up to it. Nonetheless, no arguments here about its status as the Oscar winner for Best Picture of the year. It probably deserves that title.","Nov 17, 2020"
8,Ingenuity and originality plus biting social satire = winner,"I have not seen such a movie that is so bold and daring in its originality in a long time, and that helps make this the most gripping cinema of the year, more so than any Hollywood horror and thriller movie.

Though the movie is not without flaws, such as the perplexing ending with inane logic that makes it hard to follow somewhat despite the shocking turns and twists, the director proves himself to be the master of the filmmaking craft by many years of experience.

Toward the ending, I had to think to myself, ""This director (I could not quite remember the name, but will memorize following the end) is a genius...whatta crazy movie"". That is a great compliment to the filmmakers who conjured up the most intricate structure of a thriller that also emphasizes originality.

I don't know about the political, social and economical situations of South Korea, but I imagine that the themes conveyed by this movie also applies equitably to Europe, Australia and North America, without losing the tonal cohesion and heart-rending message of supposed inequalities.

Parasite has to be one of the most original films released in the last decade, and I cannot remember the last time I saw an original movie without it being derivative, mildly, subtly or obvious. It's also the most daring in terms of urgent social messaging under guise of a dark satire worthy of Jonathan Swift's work, on par with ""Joker"".

Certainly, Parasite does not warrant the full accolades due to minor flaws that confound the otherwise hypercritical and jaded moviegoers like me, but the effort put into the structure of exposition followed by insane but carefully constructed twists is compelling as a gripping thriller that only this director Bong Joon-ho knows how to pull off effortlessly like the illusionist, and no one else, not even the veteran once-great-turned-hack American directors like Brian De Palma and Michael Mann, can try.

Just watch this movie without knowing ANYTHING about the plot. I did not even watch the trailer, and I assiduously avoided reading the reviews prior to this screening. The astonished thrills and incredulous disbelief at the directorial and storytelling ingenuity are worth it by watching this film blind without advance knowledge.

*** 1/2","Nov 2, 2019"
7,A moving though contrived dark satire,"The aptly named Parasite is a movie with a message, one that permeates through every frame and colors the interactions between characters. The class struggle between the upper and lower echelons of society (in this case the rich and their servants), is a common concept in most Asian societies and placing this dilemma at the heart of the plot is, in my opinion, its undoing. Although the idea itself is worth exploring through a work of art, it lacks the striking, bizarre and mystifying elements that make other thriller flicks appealing.

Perhaps my misgivings about the movie are mainly a consequence of my expectation that the plot would contain some major twist and supply a mind-blowing climax in the tradition of the classic thriller. Although the tale does end on a violent note, it is far from being unpredictable and even a fairly attentive viewer could foresee a similar denouement halfway through the film.

More of a satirical drama than a wild ride, Parasite moves at a rather sedate pace, and the clever con tricks that prompt a chuckle in the first act turn predictable and even lose credibility, with most supporting details seeming artificial and contrived.

The characters, though well portrayed by a talented cast, suffer the ubiquitous flaw of being agonizingly one dimensional, merely tools in the hands of the director, designed specifically to bring about certain sequences of events. Barring a single incident in the climax of the film, the characters seem to lack a will of their own, the overarching concept of class inequality embodied so perfectly in each person that they appear more like an ensemble of caricatures.

Yet praise should be doled out where it is due, and no element of the film deserves more praise than its cinematography. Despite the shortcomings of the plot, the wonderfully filmed scenes make up for them to a certain extent, the symbolic staircases, architectural secrets (wink wink) , floods and lavish garden parties yielding a veritable visual extravaganza. The score ebbs and flows beautifully with the pace of the film and complements each scene powerfully.

In summary, despite deserving some credit as a timely black satire, if a good old crime thriller is what you're looking for, Parasite is certainly not up your alley.","Jan 25, 2020"
7,One of if not the best of 2019,Absolute cinema perfection.This film is an emotional rollercoaster as a whole. It makes you connect with the characters and makes you hope but after a minute crushes your hopes and then makes you rebuild it..,"Dec 7, 2019"
7,A strange mix delivered with style,"This is certainly unique. It's strong points are excellent central performances from the ensemble cast and some good laughs in the first half. It's stylishly done, but ultimately it's a tad too silly and has a fairly bitter taste that isn't for me. If you like dark comedy though it may be for you.","Oct 23, 2020"
7,Good but not out of the ordinary,"Just watched the movie and can't say it lives up to the hype around it. It had funny moments, thriller moments and a message. It was interesting overall but the ending could have been better. I wouldn't recommend this film to a friend, for instance. Not because it was bad but because I felt that it was missing something.","Feb 11, 2020"
7,A well told tale,"A well told tale of a family of have-naughts who lie their way into a job for each member in the home of a rich family. They engineer the firing of the people they replace. People who deserved nothing of the kind. Plus the son of the pushy family disregards his promise to the friend who set him up with this rich family and he totally moves in on the little school-girl daughter he was supposed to be safe guarding. While so engaged they find a secret. Or rather a secret is given them. This movie is beautifully shot and well presented. It's a story in movements. It has the power to draw you in so much so that you forget what things were like, back there in the beginning. Back there in the basement.","Apr 23, 2020"
7,Good but nothing exceptional,"It's not a bad movie and it has some great moments. But it's way too over hyped, like much award winning movies these days (insert gif of disapproving old Clint Eastwood in Gran Torino).

7,An outstanding masterpiece.,"A brilliant must see, combined with Ho's direction, the script he co-wrote with Han, the performances of the cast, Jung's score, Hong's cinematography, Yang's editing, Lee's production design, Cho's set decoration, Choi's costume design, action sequences and visual, the story and world in which Parasite explores proves that without a doubt it rightfully won the Oscar for Best Picture of 2019 and stands as one of the absolute best films of the 2010s!!!","Jun 28, 2020"
7,"Good , over hyped","I enjoyed this movie, however my expectations were so much higher than it delivered based on the hype

Its good, but not top 50 good

I feel being a foreign language film gives it some level of credit with critics keen to promote something cool/exotic

Ask yourself how this film would have been received if set in US or UK and in English ? I feel it then would be just a good 7 out of 10 dark comedy / farce.

Definitely worth seeing, don't let the hype set your expectations too high and you'll enjoy it for what it is.","Feb 6, 2021"

7,Another American Trick,"This is a good film...a one time watch...but, nothing special about it....Just like the other OSCAR Nominated and winner films, the reason behind such a regular film to have such big release, talks and recognition is, it has made fun of Kim jong un and North Korea...just in between the scenes.....this film fall under the category of 'Brag about America or Curse it's enemy'....Again, just a one time watch!!!!","Feb 1, 2020"

7,good,"As a film about a family imposing on another, and keeping dark secrets hidden beneath the surface, Parasite achieves what Jordan Peele set out to do with Us: tell a multi-layered story in a widely entertaining manner, but without sacrificing the believability of its central narrative.

That's not to say that Us is an ineffective film by any means, but when it comes to crafting weighty social commentaries under the guise of lighter fare, writer-director Bong Joon-ho is in a class of his own.","Aug 21, 2021"
7,Not enjoyable to me,Cannot understand why it can win important award???,"Aug 29, 2019"
7,Way to americanized to be top ranked.,"As far as I know people in South Korea do not have that kind of openspoken relationship, using swearwords and sexual language. All in all it's an ok movie but as said not very realistic even for being a filmed drama/comedy/thriller.

Do NOT understand the hype.","Jan 12, 2020"
7,Do you think this is just anyone's else bussiness?,"It's tough to hear something about your smelling. The smelling of person clung by what they eat and where you live. I have a better sense of smell than the others, so I know how sensitive this trouble of smelling is.

Even if they lie their identities well and live off a wealthy family, it's hard to disappear innate lowlihead. So, smell is the metaphor. They just made fake identities and depended on their authority and goodwill, so they weren't raised up by themselves. After all, the fake position is worthless. It smells only like the fake. It can be told from by smell because it's questionable.

Although the first part was good, it was so unrealistic that I lost interest with the development at the last part. Or rather, I was excited by good going undercover drama at first!

I would say that it's not an unrealistic content at all. There's parasites like them around us. For example, some women who condescend because of the high status of her husband. And others arm themselves with luxury bland goods which are given by sugar daddy. There may be parasites in place that are closer than you'd expect.","Feb 28, 2021"
7,Very interesting,"The movie was really good! It's worth watching!

7,"Good, but not great","Quite how this managed to win best picture at the Oscars is beyond me. How it won best director is truly daft, especially up against the magnificent Sam Mendes. It's a really good first half of character set up, though they themselves are never really developed, witty and fast paced, followed by a let down of a second half that doesn't deliver on its midway point revelations.","Feb 17, 2020"
7,good but overrated,Its a very good movie thats it. but very overrated.,"Apr 4, 2020"
7,Just ok,"This movie is a vastly overrated film, but still had some cool moments. It just starts off very slow and the first hour is interesting but does drag on after a bit. The story is good, but it just goes on and on without any real purpose. It doesn't really go anywhere until the mid point, which has a really cool twist and you feel like the movie will bring up the topic of debt, but it just sort of stops. Then suddenly the final 20 minutes becomes Friday the 13th.

The biggest issue is that you never feel for the main characters. They have no backstory. They are poor, and nothing else. They can't even fold pizza boxes yet still complain when the owner takes off 10% from them. They are kinda unlikable and are pretty much scammers. They cost people their jobs by lying and we are supposed to feel bad for them? They go into people's house and stay there while the people go on trips. You just don't feel for them, and at the end they try to have this big emotional revelation but it completely fails. Why would we feel bad for a bunch of poor scammer who end up being murderers?

In the end it had some cool and intense scenes, a hot sex scene, some cool violent scenes, but it is not a masterpiece. The story really goes nowhere and in the end it just ends up exactly where it started. SNOWPIERCER is a masterpiece! Go watch that instead.

7,"not bad, but...","Derivative and too long. Is today's audience in general so stupid that metaphors must be glaringly obvious? The story has been done so many times, and may I say, better, the acting is uneven and the surreal element has much stronger authors...think Bunuel, for example. The politics rules, once again, with a not so subtle nod towards both Koreas. Quite a good movie, as movies go, but the hype is like its metaphors forced and obvious.","Feb 11, 2020"
7,Slow burn n interesting but preferred his other films,With an Oscar win and liking his previous movies mother and Snowpiercer I figured this would be great as well. It's much slower then mother and didn't find the ending to be as good either.

7,"A send-up--but of what, or whom?","Maybe this film makes a statement about class, as some claim. It could just as well be a statement about films, or the film industry. Nicely produced and well-acted, the plot was almost entirely predictable but the climax seemed contrived--though the denouement was interesting. Somehow American Beauty came to mind. That's about all I've got, having just seen it.","Feb 11, 2020"

7,Very interesting movie,"A very different film. Parasite is one of those movies that you'll probably not watch again. Once you've seen it, there is really no need for further viewings. It's not entertaining enough. It has some pretty good twists, but there not like twists in Us, Sixth Sense or Book of Eli where on second viewing things make so much more sense. It's more of a twist like in the first Saw. The movie is also a little slow. The first half is funny though, and it's always very intriguing. Good acting, great cinematography and a good ending. I understand all the hype the movie has and I think it's a good movie, but in my opinion it's not phenomenal.","Feb 6, 2020"
7,"Yes, another worthy ko drama...",Done very well even the topic is not new. The casting fits like a glove and their acting is great. However the ending is disappointing and rushed - they could have done much better than that!,"Mar 8, 2020"
7,A Solid Metaphor Film,"Let me say right away here that ""Parasite"" may very well indeed be even better than a 7/10 star film. For my viewing experience, there were a number of factors that may well have dampened the overall experience. No matter how you slice it, though, ""Parasite"" is a solid metaphor film that engages both on surface and deep levels.

For a very basic overview, this film focuses on two families in South Korea: The Kims are the definition of poor, living in a cramped sub-street level apartment and barely scraping together enough to subside. The Parks are much wealthier, living in a spacious mansion and employee tutors, drivers, and a housekeeper. Through a serious of events both fortuitous and comical, all four Kims become employed (in varying capacities) by the Kims. The juxtaposition between ""clans"" is readily apparent, and brought to an even starker contrast when a momentous discovery changes/defines the entire back half of the film's narrative.

On the surface, ""Parasite"" is pretty entertaining, using a multi-genre approach to keep the viewer's interest. While watching, you will be treated to comedy, drama, farce, seriousness, etc. There is never a dull moment, in other words, and the acting is strong throughout. The subtitles only take a few minutes to get used to (from an American viewer perspective) and will quickly become second nature, so don't let that be the reason you may shy away from this movie.

More importantly, though, ""Parasite"" is also very much a metaphor movie, dealing with class structures and the fundamentals of capitalism itself. I won't go into spoiler details here, but there are much deeper meanings here than simply what is visually/physically portrayed. Multiple, deeper readings/viewings of the material are very easy to pick out and analyze.

Like I said in the opening paragraph, ""Parasite"" may be objectively higher than 7/10 stars. For me, though, it was watched during a nationwide pandemic state, in which it was hard to focus on the issues these filmmakers wanted to put forth. Also, and this is very much a personal preference, I prefer metaphor films to ""sneak up on me"" as opposed to knowing that going in. With this film, though, the cat was out of the bag after the Academy Awards, which is when it will garner the majority of its popular viewings. So, I knew to look for the ""deeper stuff"" from the get-go, and I feel like that may have influenced by overall viewing experience (and perhaps not for the better).

So, as of right now, I'm giving ""Parasite"" a 7/10 ranking. A solid film that I enjoyed, but not necessarily amongst my personal all-time favorites. Perhaps upon a second viewing in a different personal/social climate, it will climb the ranks further. It certainly won't go any lower.","Mar 24, 2020"
7,"Upsetting premise, goes down hill from there!","Ok ok, I've got to give it to the filmmakers that this unusual film is beautiful shot & acted. But for me, it was also a disheartening mess, taking dreadful closterphobic turns as it descended into the depths.","Nov 4, 2019"

7,Really enjoyable film but not quite the classic I thought it would be,"This is my first experience of Korean cinema (although I have watched many foreign language films). The subtitles may put off some but I care more about the story.

This is a really good film which is equally funny as it engrossing and then nearer the end quite moving.

The tone is a tad all over the place, which I'm sure is likely the aim but for me it makes it harder to land that emotional pull to make you really emphasise with the characters.

I would argue the film translates to me that family and belonging are the themes to take away.

So overall I would say I enjoyed the film and would say go see it for the experience, but if I'm honest I wouldn't choose to add it to my collection.","Feb 24, 2020"
7,Worth a Watch,"Lots of reviews complain of a lack of realism and plenty of comments cover the 'intellegent' and 'clever' social aspect of the movie.

I think people lost something in translation somehow. This is a black comedy and it's a pretty funny one at that. Think Severance with slighly less gore and a sprinkling of Faulty Towers. The only peice that felt out of place for me was the ending which was much too sentimental to fit the movie (I think black comedies are notoriously hard to end fittingly anyway).

The 'class' thing plays a role in the movie simply to support it's outrageous plot. True, it surfaces in the end between Mr Park and Kim but it's never explored intellectually enough to hang your hat on.

An intriguing plot, plenty of good acting (Song Kang-Ho the pick), some good scripted banter that translated well and some very good cinematography. (I do have to say the one sex scene is actually quite graphic and ,although there is no nudity, is more akin to a Korean soft porn movie!)

Go into this film willing to take it at face value and you'll probably enjoy it. 7.6.","Oct 15, 2021"

7,Completely original,"There's a lot to Parasite. A very complex story, only a few sets, but dozens of strands.

In some ways, it's a very good film. For example, the imagery is outstanding. Also, it's one of the most original films I have ever seen. I never guessed what was going to happen next. I was completely surprised remarkably often. Bit this also brings with it a negative. So much happens that the film started to drag for me. I noticed I was getting restless and was genuinely grateful when the film ended.

The acting is good for the most part, but occasionally reaches theatrical heights, which felt tonaly wrong.

Overall, I'm glad I watched it.","Dec 16, 2019"

7,"""The Parasite Case""","With a light comedy tone and a very insightful vision, Bong Joon Ho begins an agile story about social classes, their differences and paradoxically their similarities, with great sharpness he also analyzes the legitimate aspirations of social promotion... But at what price? From this thesis, many themes and subtopics emerge: simulation, lies, threats, which lead to stronger ones: revenge, hatred. Bong Joon Ho brings such control of his film that he even turns technologies (cellular) into one more protagonist, who will always be present throughout its history. So far so good, but the climax of ""Parasite"" its conclusion and its end depart from its very interesting beginning, the director seems to want to change now the tone of his comedy towards drama and / or terror, only to end up losing control of his narrative with a grotesque denouement. Consequently the film reduces its intensity and interest with which it started, becoming confusing and anticlimactic. ""A case of parasitosis that quickly went viral and spread to Hollywood itself, who began to distribute prizes..."" Casting includes Kang-ho Song, Sun-kyun Lee, Yeo-jeong Jo, Woo-sik Choi, So-dam Park. Sarcastic sequence of the confrontation with the old housekeeper, who uses the cell phone to threaten, as if it were a weapon.","Apr 8, 2020"

Acting was very good and the characters were played very well. I don't thing its a movie that you would watch again though, thus 7.","Feb 13, 2021"
7,"""It's so metaphorical""",A good movie with no jarring flaws. The only trouble I have with it is that it could've been better. I'm guessing a lot of the film's subtlety is lost in translation because I wasn't overly impressed by all of the metaphors. I feel like I got a firm grasp of everything that went on and what it meant while I was watching and it hasn't left much of a lasting impression on me. I could be failing to see things but I wish it was a bit more dense. I kind of think the movie is a little overrated and think that some people like it so they can say they like foreign films.,"Feb 10, 2020"
7,7/10 plot holes and more plot holes,"Movie isn't necessary a masterpiece if it is foreign movie! and certainly isn't a comedy genre. Movie is aesthetically attractive but it is mostly filmed indoors on two locations.Soundtrack is unnoticeable. I expected much of this movie but than reality kicked soon. After almost 90 minutes of pure boredom, movie suddenly transforms into typical Korean horror movie, which might be appealing to some teenagers but not to me. Weakest part of movie is unconvincing story.For example: parents are poor,badly educated and unemployed but suddenly,overnight, father becomes perfect personal driver of luxury Mercedes limousine and mother ideal housekeeper.Daughter on other hand has vast knowledge about art history. Nobody knows about house basement/panic room and perfect luxury villa doesn't have a single camera or video surveillance...yeah,right... That's how you make scenarios for typical B-grade horror movie,not for serious melodrama.","Jan 30, 2020"
7,A new pattern of Korean culture,"Now it's the time to stop that longing, Parasite was just flashed me through my mind and filled that completion of my waiting. Since it was released, it was talked, it was going for awards and it created a history in Academy Awards I was so far and keen to watch this movie and it veils the curtain now. As a movie, it is worth watching because I'm not used to the socio-political aspects of Korean culture. The film describes the class variations and social norm dividing people into rich and poor. But actually what makes me attractive is that kind comic blending at the beginning by the family to enter into the Park mansion. Going smoothly, sometimes it provides a little bit tense and frights the film has a steady graph till the end and then it hype accidentally and I feel astonished. The mood of the movie changed vice-versa and it shook me for some time. A very changing pattern of Korean society and Korean classification was the major essence that I can find in the movie.","Feb 27, 2020"

7,It's a simple message,The movie's poster looks like it's going to be a thriller/horror genre but I was wrong. It was more drama and reality. I was not that impressed with the storyline. The actors did a good performance of realness but for me this movie does not really add something new to me knowledge that I would had never thought of. I must say the production was great as South Korea really is known for their Dramas which is similar to this movie. Will definitely recommend people of this movie but for me the x factor is missing and also the ending is a bit odd and not well planned. Thats it for me. Thanks for reading.,"Mar 10, 2020"

Not entirely, but there was so much of Chan-wook Park's The Handmaiden in this movie. Just minus the lesbian story and plus the social commentary on rich and the poor. If you put that aside, it's was a really strange movie for me - the first part of the movie was rather dull, but the second was much intense and even quite shocking. The ending was great and made me think about this movie for few days. So - 7/10.","Apr 20, 2020"
7,Overrated,"I mean it was pretty good but nothing to get so excited about. The plot is solid and keeps you engaged throughout, maybe dropping off a bit towards the end.

7,Entertaining and shocking twists,"Parasite stands as a cinematic tour de force, a film that transcends genres and defies easy categorization. Bong Joon-ho's directorial brilliance is on full display in this Korean masterpiece, a compelling and thought-provoking exploration of class divisions that seamlessly weaves together dark humor, suspense, and social commentary.

From the opening scenes, it captivates with its meticulous attention to detail and visual storytelling. The cinematography by Hong Kyung-pyo is nothing short of breathtaking, capturing the stark contrast between the cramped living conditions of the Kim family and the opulent luxury of the Park residence. Each frame is a visual feast, contributing to the film's immersive experience.

The narrative unfolds with a gripping precision, as the Kim family, struggling in the lower echelons of society, cunningly infiltrates the lives of the wealthy Park family. The plot twists and turns with a surprising and relentless momentum, keeping the audience on the edge of their seats. Bong Joon-ho's screenplay is a work of art, seamlessly blending elements of comedy, drama, and thriller into a cohesive and engaging story.

Central to the film's success are the stellar performances from the cast. Song Kang-ho leads with a nuanced portrayal of the patriarch, Kim Ki-taek, navigating the complexities of his character with finesse. The entire ensemble, including Choi Woo-shik, Park So-dam, and Lee Sun-kyun, deliver performances that breathe life into their multifaceted roles, creating a palpable on-screen chemistry.

The movie is more than just a suspenseful thriller; it's a profound commentary on societal inequality. Bong Joon-ho skillfully uses the Kim family's strategic infiltration of the Park household as a lens through which to examine the stark contrasts between the haves and the have-nots. The film prompts viewers to reflect on the systemic issues of class disparity and the lengths individuals may go to escape the constraints of poverty.

Beyond its social commentary, it also explores the universality of human desires and the consequences of unchecked ambition. The characters, while navigating their respective socio-economic challenges, grapple with themes of morality, identity, and the pursuit of a better life.

In conclusion, this is a cinematic triumph, a film that not only entertains but also challenges and provokes thought. Bong Joon-ho's masterful direction, coupled with outstanding performances and a richly layered narrative, makes it a standout in contemporary cinema. This Korean gem deserves every accolade it has received, marking a pivotal moment in the global recognition of the richness and depth of Korean filmmaking.","Nov 9, 2023"
7,Didn't meet my expectations,"Given the overall rating on IMDB, I was expecting something a little bit more. It's a nice idea, and well executed for the most part. The ending...hmm. Perhaps it works in Korean culture but I found it disappointing, and it seemed to me that the writer just ran out of steam.

But overall worth a look. The humorous touches were great.","Nov 29, 2021"
7,Good Picture? Yes. Best Picture? No.,"Here we have a good example of story telling. The characters are presented in a such a way you can't help but feel empathy for their poor conditions. The characters don't really grow however, they aren't shown at any point to have progressed or have learnt anything, meaning they weren't really used to their full empathetic potential. The cinematography is rather beautiful, and keeps the story moving elegantly. But did it deserve the oscar? No. 1917 ticks every single box. It's enthralling, it's unique, the characters develop, and at the end you're left speechless. At the end of this, I didn't feel much. I'm glad it won the oscar, foreign films deserve high praise and are often overlooked, but i'd watch 1917 again and again and still feel as emotional and captivated, is that not what a best picture is supposed to achieve?","Jan 9, 2021"
7,Didn't resonate with me,"As well crafted as this film is, with gorgeous cinematography, a decent soundtrack and brilliant acting, I just found it too much of a slow burner with no payoffs to justify it. I have been a fan of slow burners in the past, namely Interstellar and Bladerunner 2049 being two of my favourite films, yet they had arguably much better stories and spectacles throughout to make up for it. I heard Mark Kermode say this film delivers much of its plot visually yet I found the majority of the plot to be delivered with only dialogue or monologue. The supposed climax never really peaked enough, the horror wasn't all that tense or shocking and the comedy didn't land otherwise to carry it through. Furthermore, the references and foreshadowing throughout the film to later events could have been more creative. Finally, the 3rd act and ending felt like it could have been more meaningful and conveyed the Director's discourse with more conviction. Again, I don't want to deny the craftsmanship and deeper thinking into this film. There's some real consideration that's been put into this and a good attempt at making a pertinent and contemporary social commentary. Yet for me, it just didn't work. Nevertheless, I invite you to try this one out for yourself.","Dec 19, 2020"

7,Certainly overrated,"I was really impressed by the direction, no doubt and few other aspects of the movie but certainly not worth of Oscar. Just a normal movie which was going good until everything went beyond reality and started going haywire. Would have been much better if it have kept the thrilling story of their play in other difficult situations without being all gory at the end! Overall good till 1:30 hrs. Later it's just not amazing.

Even though the characters weren't in a black or white scheme, i didn't felt connected to something real and the main deceit plot was not that engaging. So its about certain rich people dehumanizing poor people, this was not enough new there for me.

This movie could be more for movie lovers who are into artistic shots,novel characters and symbolism.","Apr 19, 2020"
7,Best Korean Film of All Time - Parasite,"This is the best Korean film of all time. Now that is not really saying much, as Korean films generally finish fourth in a competition with Chinese, Japanese and Indian films in Asia. But if this film is any indication, Korea may be on the cusp of jumping over one of their competitors in Asia. This black comedy has the feel of Coen Brothers special, though not quite as pithy or broad. There is more character development here than in most Coen films (with the exception of Fargo). Joon-Ho does a great job of writing and directing and brings his vision home to roost without any apparent flaws. Each actor in the film does a very nice job, with the daughter of the hustler family (I love good hustler films) doing an outstanding turn. I look forward to Joon-Ho's next project.","Jan 31, 2020"
7,Its suprised me,"I gave 7 for this movie. I dont like the ending they killed each others. Really bad for reflection, why not they helping each others by buying 1 apartment and live ever after.. But its like a normal live we lived today.. Poor and rich Good and bad Loved and hated","Aug 9, 2019"
7,A Good Satire about Social Class,"Parasite is a very enjoyable film. There are no heroes in this story, just tragic anti-heroes. The first half of the film is a convenient build-up to a spectacular second half. It is a satire that pits the have and have-nots against each other. Morality is lost somewhere in the need for survival. It's a enjoyable film with an unexpected ending. Definitely worth a watch for a Cinema-lover. The subtitles are not hard to follow for a Non-Korean audience. I dropped it from 8 stars to 7 because of some voice-over narration towards the end that was very different from the tone of the rest of the film.","Nov 8, 2019"
7,Overrated,Its a little overrated. 7.5/10. Not bad not so good.,"May 3, 2021"
7,Solid but over-hyped.,"This film is very nicely shot and had some entertaining moments in it. The cast are great and the story has some unexpected twists.

Overall I would definitely recommend watching it, however I really can't understand how it won best picture and best director at the academy awards. In that sense the film is quite mediocre as it doesn't leave a lasting impression as most Oscar winning films do.

My guess is the Academy lording diversity at the risk of social criticism.","Feb 16, 2020"
7,With No Plan Nothing Can Go Wrong,"Parasite landed with a massive splash in 2019, Bong Joon-ho's satirical black comedy is excruciatingly tense and a fantastic confection. Its bracing cynicism makes it drop slightly short of being a clarion call to revolution and it has a few too many endings for me but the unpeeling of this particular onion is tremendously fun. It's easy to see why it did as well as it did.","Oct 30, 2021"
7,Probably not something you have seen before - in a good way,"O What I enjoyed most about Parasite is the complete culture shock: from a ""Western"" perspective, very few people will have seen a film like this. The mannerisms of the cast (both the rich socialites and the lowly main characters) is unique to this film, along with the settings used throughout the movie. This not only delivers novel cinematography, but combined with this unique story, Parasite is worth watching for the experience alone. The acting is strong right through the story, with some excellent framing and shot shaping to emphasise certain points. By the end, you can see what got Bong Joon-ho nominated for all these awards - and you would have to agree, he probably deserved to win most of them too.","Jan 23, 2021"
7,Good but not as much as they say.,"This movie delivers everything you can expect after watching the trailer. It's an enterntaining dark comedy that has some ""drama"" and even has some tense, thrillerish moments. It won't dissapoint you, but it's not the best movie of the year, nor the best korean movie ever made. It's not even that weird or unpredictable. It's just a good movie, not an otherwordly experience. But it won't dissapoint you, you should definitely watch it.","Jan 10, 2020"
7,"A good and light movie, but overrated","Parasite is one of good movies directed by boong joon ho, but I think the best from him was ""memories of murder"" movie, and this movie is number 2.

The lead character acting was flawless, especially kang-ho song. He the only one that brings thrill to the story.

I think this movie is lighter than memories of murder, but i think more people like it. I think parasite a little bit overrated.","Oct 17, 2021"
7,"Didn't deserve best picture, but still a wild ride","The 2020 best picture winner is a sleeper hit that started to get some buzz last summer, translating positive word-of-mouth into Oscar gold in February. 'Parasite' may be the first foreign language film to win the honor, but it's fair to say it isn't the best foreign language film to make an impression on audiences.

Still, there's no denying the cultural impact Bong Joon Ho's dark family thriller has had since making the rounds at film festivals and theater chains. The two families at the center of 'Parasite's plot deserve much credit for what they were able to deliver - a gripping thriller that also serves as a social commentary on modern South Korean society. Aside from the acting, the execution of the plot, filled with more twists and turns than you'd expect from a best picture honoree, is top-notch. And then there's the climax - talk about a series of events that were not expected. Understandably, this earned Ho a ""best original screenplay"" award - and for that, 'Parasite' did deserve the recognition.

While it is not the highest quality film released in the past year, 'Parasite' is a edge-of-your-seat, original effort that borrows some of the best elements from previous releases in the genre and takes things to another level.","Mar 14, 2020"
7,"""With no plan, nothing can go wrong""","Metascore 96, IMDb Top Rated Movies #26, higher than "" The Green Mile"", ""Léon"", ""The Usual Suspects"", ""C'era una volta il West"", ""Django Unchained"", ""The Shining"", ""A Clockwork Orange"", even ""2001: A Space Odyssey""... Oscars for Best Picture (first one ever for a film that's not in English), directing and screenplay and Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival... close to five hundred nominations and awards... I honestly don't get it.

The movie really is good, but in any of the categories I could possibly classify it, it wouldn't be at the top. I came across comments that the film successfully combines almost all genres. I don't know what they were watching, but I was watching a morbid drama about a ""con-artist"" family and social stratification. Comedy, thriller, horror, ... were we watching the same movie. And if someone asked me to recommend him a good South Korean movie, I don't think, in a few months, this one would even come to my mind at all. In a similar fashion, I would probably recommend ""Oldeuboi,"" which, although I saw it a couple of years ago and gave it a seven, I remember as I saw it yesterday. And regardless of the genre, the first association with a South Korean film would definitely be ""A Moment to Remember.""

I'm not saying it's not worth a look. Those who love well-shot sickness and modern South Korean cinema should definitely not miss it, but I certainly won't re-watch it.

And finally, one question - does the movie's title refer to the Kim family or the Park family ?! I think this is an interesting topic to think about. I guess the author meant poor fraudsters, but from my perspective, their employers are essentially bigger parasites.

7,It kept me interested but not really worth the high rating in my opinion.,"I felt there was a lot of unused themes, like the Chekhov's gun principle and the family was fairly smart but jobless, it doesn't fit. More goofy than a masterpiece. All in all it was a decent movie and worth my time, I think its rating though is inflated by the social class messages throughout the movie.","Apr 17, 2020"
7,Slightly Over rated one,The narration in first half is slightly misleading by being racy while the actual film is meant to be about class divide and how the rich and poor see each other. The film would be more classy if the narration style was consistent. Still a good watch,"Jan 18, 2020"

7,An odd movie ... but good,"I can't help but think that if I were Korean, I'd somehow catch more nuances and details ... and end up appreciating this movie a bit more.

I kind of wish Bong Joon Ho called it something else. Since he's done several well-received sci-fi themed movies, I couldn't get it out of my head that ""maybe"" a sub-plot in the movie involved sinister parasites. Nope - it's purely a metaphor. And that's still fine.

I liked the movie and was interested to see how it developed. But I wouldn't say it was spine-tinglingly suspenseful, shocking or fully engrossing. There were a couple of plot twists that took the movie in new directions. However, I don't think Ho was able to fully capitalize and leverage the twists after the moment had past.

The story is unusual but I didn't find myself having any thought-provoking ideas after the show was over. No doubt it still was interesting to watch the story of two families from different socioeconomic classes interact. It kept my attention throughout it's 2 hour runtime ... but I'd still call it ""good"" ... not ""great"".","Nov 2, 2019"
7,Nice twists and a good ending,"This is a nice movie to watch.. All the twists and turns makes the movie really interesting. Actors were all very good.

I wish I could have dubbed the language over to English.","Nov 26, 2021"
7,A good film but not best of the year,"Parasite tells a quite surreal story which could absolutely happen. The characters are realistic, I liked how nobody is a clear good guy or bad guy. On the other side maybe you need to be the part of Korean culture to fully appreciate it, but for me it didn't hold that emotional drama that many other viewers liked. It wasn't that funny in the comedic scenes, and other than the social cass divide which is seen in many other movies it wasnt really deep either. Overall a good movie, but did not deserve the oscars it got, especially considering Jojo Rabbit was another contender for best picture, and in my opinion blew out Parasite from the water in every regards","May 15, 2020"
7,"Good movie, but highly overrated !","The movie is pretty engaging and great performances by the actors, but all the drama before the oscars etc and hyesteria around this film was definitely unnecessary!

7,The Novelty Of Reading Subtitles,"'Parasite' [Dir. Bong Joon Ho, 2019, South Korea].

I think some foreign language films become overrated due to many movie-watchers not being book-readers, or, the novelty of reading whilst 'watching' (glancing up between dialogue) is probably where people are deriving pleasure.

You're barely able to watch the film while you're reading the subtitles at the bottom of the screen, so you're unable to judge the acting and cinematography. They're speaking in a foreign language too, so it's impossible to rate the delivery of lines. I doubt this film is rated as highly by Koreans.

Parasite is good, quite original, but certainly overrated. The story is reasonably straight forward, and not the mysterious thriller the original trailer advertises it to be.

The comedy only exist as humorous moments that can exist in everyday life, whilst the drama isn't believable or impactful.

Who is the titular 'parasite'? Well, we can assume all the people working for the wealthy family are the parasites. It's a quick development of the plot when an entire impoverished family rapidly gain employment at the rich family's lavish home through skilled deception, skills which seem unlikely in origin according to earlier scenes.

Of course, their new source of income goes off-rails as quickly as it had begun, but certainly not in a deep, 'Hitchcockian', or clever way.

Many elements of the film are not fleshed out or are dead ends: The family went from folding pizza boxes to being master conmen; What was the relevance of the ornamental rock?; Why did the young man basically adopt the life of his friend?; Why was it briefly implied the rich man didn't love his wife?; What were the drugs he mentioned he'd buy her?; What became of the boy's deciphered Morse code?; How did the young man send a letter to his father?; Was the end a dream?

So, Parasite is not a funny film, and not particularly thrilling, dramatic, clever, or suspenseful. The (music) score is ok, but it's hard to comment on the acting as it's a foreign language movie, and the photography is hard to judge when you're reading the almost non-stop text at the bottom of the screen. There's no particular moral to the story to learn, other than, maybe, not pushing your luck, and tolerating an unpleasant smell.

However, from the originality, and what you can discern from the plot, it's still an engaging film - even if that's largely from the novelty of reading subtitles.

7/10 - Not as good as Cinema Paradiso [1988, Director's Cut, 173 min].","Mar 28, 2021"
7,a very capable film maker here who needs to get himself a decent script writer,"One of director, Bong Joon Ho's favourite cinematic ploys is to mix up the genres. I remember being most unhappy watching his earlier Host (2006) when a perfectly acceptable horror film was interspersed with social comment on the various family members back home. There are great films and great genre films and I can enjoy both but they are different animals. Mr Ho seems to want to do away with the thoughtful script and writing needed for the former and use a mixing of the genre to make up for lack of depth. With Parasite we have, for about an hour, a very decent story building, even if it is becoming more and more far fetched. The big surprise certainly surprised me but not as much as the change that then befall the film and my mind began to wander as all the seriousness fell away. We have a very capable film maker here who needs to get himself a decent script writer. Writing is clearly not his forte and his urge to slip off piste needs, in my opinion, to be restrained so that his wondrous cinematic chemistry can cook away without losing the plot.","Feb 18, 2020"

I want to give it 10/10 but I have problem with ending .. it make me a little bit disappointed at the first I think the movie have a great message that says '' every dollar you pay today tommorow in future you will get it'' but the ending destroyed this quote .. at all thx for this great masterpiece 👏🏻👏🏻,"Nov 15, 2019"
7,"Suspenseful, but...","Parasite is a South Korean Movie directed by Joon Ho Bong, who also directed Snowpiercer, Okja, and most brilliantly Mother. Now this movie probably has more twists and turns than any of his other films, which is saying a lot.

You never know where the story is headed so there's a lot of suspense throughout the film. At first, you're given a glimpse into the lives of a family living in wretched poverty. Their wifi doesn't work, their basement dwelling gets flooded, and worst of all the local drunk pisses right outside their door. Perhaps this is what makes the family turn into a band of scam artists. That's actually one of the things that bothers me about the film. All of the family members are fully integrated in the criminal activities without any second thoughts about how it will affect the victims. I wanted to see more fleshed out characters who question each other and themselves. I wanted there to be a reason for their turning out the way they did. Poverty isn't enough.

Even so, the cataclysmic turn of events is more than enough to keep you engaged. The conniving planning that goes into their schemes keeps you entertained for the first hour. After that a curveball is thrown at them, as well as us, the audience.

And again more characters are shown to be treacherous without any explanation as to how they arrived to have that mindset. I'm sorry to point this out again, but it gets irksome. I expected more from the director of the masterpiece, Mother. That is a film that kept me engaged because the characters had motives, even though those motives were somewhat ambiguous. Despite all my criticisms, Parasite is a suspenseful thriller with plenty of content to keep you enthralled for its entirety.","Aug 27, 2019"
7,Post Oscar Review,"I watched Parasite yesterday before the Oscars, and was truly disappointed. The ending just turned what could've been a great movie into a good one.

7,Okay-ist movie of the year.,No need for a long review. This movie was just OK. I'm not impressed.,"Feb 17, 2020"
7,It's fine. I just didn't think it was as great as everyone else seems to think.,"I am going to be unpopular here because it's unfashionable to do anything other than laud Parasite from the rooftops.

Let's get a couple of things straight before the off.

I have no issue with the 'One inch barriers"" to universal film appreciation that director Bong Joon Ho describes subtitles as. I have seen thousands of subtitled movies and Scandi Noirs.

I have no, unlike Mr Trump, political bias against (sorry, not bias, prejudice in Trump's case) South Korean cinema. Indeed I recently reviewed Chan Wook-Park's The Handmaiden as 10 stars on IMDB. (Oldboy is a classic from Park, too.)

I also loved Ho's Okja and The Host, although I thought his English-speaking Snowpiercer was truly awful.

So this is not the problem, and just because I'm not raving about this doesn't mean I didn't enjoy it, I did. I just feel the praise that's being lavished upon it is greater than my appreciation.

I read one review on IMDB by 'mysticfall' that suggested anyone who didn't love this was a moron and clearly didn't understand it.

I had no issue with understanding it.

It's essentially a movie about class and privilege in which Ho brings together South Korea's richest and poorest in one household, with the poorest as servants, and sets up a scenario where he does not judge either for their caste.

Except he does.

As the film progresses it's clear that the master of the house has an ingrained prejudice against the poor that manifests itself in his inability to understand or articulate that it's their 'smell' that reeks of poverty, and is therefore undesirable.

Variously described as a comedy and horror it leans far more to the former with some extremely funny lines and a pretty strong dose of slapstick - as seen in Reece Shearsmith and Steve Pemberton's excellent Inside Number 9 episode - A Quiet Night In in which two cat-burglars attempt to steal paintings from an occupied house without a word of dialogue.

Almost all of Act 2 of Parasite was essentially this episode.

The horror that we are promised is actually gore, and is reserved for Act 3. It's very much in the school of Tarantino, and, of course, Tarantino himself is heavily influenced by Asian film-making, so a certain circle is squared.

The performances are universally excellent but I feel that, on occasion, Ho strays into slightly heavy-handed territory - much in evidence in his direction of Snowpiercer. It's not enough to spoil anything, but it clashes with the adulatory reviews I've read.

The cinematography is simply beautiful.

It's a fine movie, but in my view 1917 was a more immersive cinematic experience and consequently deserved the Best Picture Academy Award.

Call me what you like, but I'm saying what I'm seeing.","Feb 24, 2020"
7,Will the real parasite please stand up?,"We see a family that gradually starts to feed off of a privileged family which is clear. But at the same time it showed us how it is actually the opposite, the privileged depending on the lower classes in a very disturbing way. The rich generic family needed a 'help' for almost everything in their life. For tutoring the kids(and much more than just tutoring academics), for making food, for supporting the mother who actually has no idea on how to live her life or form an opinion, for driving the father etc and even...for the dynamic between the husband and wife. It showed that most of their conversations were about the 'help'. This is in fact what most of the very privileged people do in society is depend a lot on the people doing work for them, and not see them as actual beings with their own families and lives. It is a form of usage that goes very far and the usage of the underprivileged in a very disproportioned power structure creates a co-dependant relationship. (E.g. The man adoring the master). And many times it costs a lot, for the underprivileged. The poor classes have no choice but to invest so much time in someone else's family, instead of in their own, because they need the salary. The upperclass knows this very well and abuses their power for this.

The dynamic of the 'poor' family in the movie was very enjoyable and pulled me in the movie. The story started out very interesting, but - to me - it fell flat towards the end. It could have been so much better , with a better storyline. Im not saying I want a happy ending and definitely am not a lover of clichés. I just wanted it to develop more. It feels that right in the middle of the development of the story it suddenly went flat. A nice movie, i don't care about awards (its all politics anyhow), a good one time watch, and maybe a rewatch to revisit the crazy antics in the beginning and middle of the movie. Favourite character : the poor dad.","Feb 23, 2020"

( which in this movie is not even portrayed as being amoral or deserving it in some other ways )

filmed well, acted well, good thrills, but as expected in this genre, a shocking ending and a messy denouement.

But nothing special

for professional and amateur critics to comment that this is a rumination on class struggle, oppression of the poor and the comeuppance for the rich, just shows that they either never watched the film and allowed whatever political prejudice they have to write the film criticism for them, or that they are easily swayed by these professional critics.","May 23, 2020"

7,Debauchery,"I didn't think this movie was an amazing masterpiece but I didn't detest it either. it was simply a bit more than okay for me. The story fell a bit flat when I watched it. I enjoyed the tangled web the Kim family wove around the Park family. I almost felt like you were supposed to feel more sadness and empathy for the Kim family. I can't say that I did feel that emotion but I felt I understood why they did the things they did. I enjoyed the story line within quite a bit more than the main. Overall I wasn't blown away but I think it was written, acted and directed extremely well. I'd like to see more from this director. His shots were impressive.","May 10, 2020"
7,"Good movie for sure, but over-rated like anything else before...","I have deep roots in Korea and for obvious reasons i like korean cinematography. In this case i am really pleased that this movie is the first ever in history to have won an oscar as the best movie of the year and not being an english speaking one. What i do not get, is the hype around it. It is an OK movie, like a modern black-noir comedy thriller about nowadays korean society, and it depicts it quite well...BUT this is not enough to be so astonishingly over-rated. Tons of korean movies are better, but for some reason this year, whole word decided to give PARASITE the green light to the top of movies sancta sanctorum world.","Feb 16, 2020"
7,What happens AFTER you watch the film is very intriguing.,"So PARASITE...this film makes you think and laugh and gasp all in one scene. Part of me felt like a voyeur watching a film about the political and socio-economic problems in the Koreas. There was so much symbolism. The class struggles, the haves and have nots, the disparities, and ""blindness"" of the rich toward the underprivileged and disenchanted, forced to live underground. The""peeing man"" for me, represented the Elvis loving crazy dictator, 45's favorite, potential button pushing maniac, he scares me. Kim Jong-un, who is reckless and careless and pees all over everyone anytime he pleases, yet no one can stop him...sound familiar? This film took satirical chances that we do not always take in American filmmaking. And with an unstable, murderer at the helm of a shaky ship in N. Korea that was bold, very bold. It went everywhere and took us on quite a journey. IMHO, I felt it went to crazy town once the Con Artist family made the underground discovery and then it just crashed through the ceiling at the party. BUT, it made me think and I was compelled to talk about it and wrestle with what I just watched after it was over. Isn't that what film is for?","Jan 16, 2020"
7,Am I missing something?,"I watched ""Parasite"" a Korean film last night. I have been hearing how great this movie is and how IMDB rating is 8.5 IGN 9.5 Rotten Tomatoes giving it 100%. Well, am I missing something? I do think it's a good film but almost a perfect 10 I don't feel that. The actions of the main family seems so realist. The story, the way it's written, and just the performance of the actors is good. You can imagine that something like this can maybe happen to people that is just gullible. But I felt like everything was very predictable. But some questions were unanswered Like, Why was the original house keeper (Moon-gwang) face messed up? Why the little boy (Park Da-song) have special sense in smell with all of them and Why was he so wild in the beginning and calm and good later on? Why did the father (Kim Ki-taek) have an odor that smells so bad that it couldn't be disguised or washed off? I do like the Director (Joon-ho Bong) and other films he had made but I just feel like this movie is more a 6.5 / 7 for me.","Sep 9, 2019"
7,Don't see what all the fuss is about.,"It's like the world, for the first time, found a box of Korean movies. Having never seen a Korean film they eagerly grabbed one off the top and watched it, and said, 'oh my God, this is the best thing ever'. My advice is to keep digging in that box. There's a lot more that are a lot better in there.","Jul 14, 2020"
7,Not that good.,"I had a few expectations about this film but I was a little concerned because I dont like to lose time. Decided to give it a try and was surprised by the trama until middle of the film, when it changes completely from drama to futile violence. Really disappointed.","Mar 22, 2021"
7,Innovative but messy and over-the-top,"9 star rating from YMS and a Palm d'Or. What have we here? A dark comedy from a great Korean director going back to his roots? Nois. I'll make sure I pay close attention to this one.

As expected, this film is good. However it could have easily been bad, if not for the brilliant cinematography, strong directorial sense, and most of all, thought provoking messages and philosophies that don't hold back at reflecting the brutal reality of class in our society. However, you aren't here to see me laud, you want to know why I don't hold it in as high regards as everyone else.

The film feels messy. Although the comedy is often effective, I don't think it fits well enough in this context. The story is innovative, though it does feel familiar in certain parts. The sudden mood changes aren't my cup of tea as well.

A lot of the plot points are just too over the top. They can be distracting. They can be too weird, especially regarding the climax/ending (you'll know what I mean). There are little bits of details that never got an answer till the end; or maybe I need more time to think about them, who knows. Lastly, the message is a little bit too obvious and shoehorned in.

It is hard to talk about the many aspects of the film without spoilers. At the end of the day I'll still highly recommend this film because, after all it is a good film, and supporting lesser known but highly acclaimed directors is always a good gesture. But I'm still in the process of figuring out why people love it so much. I guess I'm not too appreciative of Korean films considering my 7/10 rating for The Handmaiden, but this is open to change, and if you are willing to engage in well mannered discussion with me, I may learn to like it much more than I do.","Jun 21, 2019"
7,Mainly visuals,A good movie in which the plot plays 'second fiddle' to the incredible visuals. The social message is obvious and the story is more like a graphic novel.,"Feb 17, 2020"
7,Unpredictable,"This was a breath of freah air, very original. Had no idea what was going to happen next...even till the end. Well acted. Just wish I understood Korean!","Dec 7, 2021"
7,Parasites Meet the Wild West,"This Oscar winning, best picture, film can best be described as a far-fetched dark comedy. An impoverished family living in the slums of Seoul, gradually integrate themselves into a wealthy upscale family, one by one, through a web of lies and deception. They manage to get the help fired, then surreptitiously plan to get themselves hired in their stead. The plan works fine, until complications arise with the fired, longtime former housekeeper/chef showing up to take care of some unfinished business. She discovers their 'plan' and threatens to expose them. All hell breaks loose and this very funny comedy-drama suddenly goes in another unexpected direction.

This is entertaining cinema, well acted, directed and written. I would wholeheartedly recommend it.","Apr 15, 2022"
7,A bit overrated,"Sure Parasite it's an original, well directed, and captivating movie, but it's not the masterpiece of this decade. I guess Sam Mendez has been quite deceived not receiving the best picture with 1917 instead of this movie.","May 8, 2020"
7,"A strange mix of genre styles (social drama, thriller and comedy all in one)","The appreciation for ""Parasite"" is I think partially dependent on the expectations that you have in advance.

I expected to see a movie in line with ""The handmaiden"" (2016, Chan Wook Park) or (an older example) ""The servant"" (1963, Joseph Losey) where the servants gradually take over the power. My expectations where also rather high given the ecxellent South Korean thriller ""Burning"" (2018, Chang Dong Lee) that I saw recently. Both films share the same cinematographer (Kyung Pyo Hong).

My expectations where not fulfilled. There is no slow change in the power balance between masters and servants but the cunning servants overwhelm their naive masters in a breathtaking tempo. In this stage the film has a caricatural / comedy element in it that was not to my taste. It is rather difficult to combine the crime and comedy genres, and only the Coen brothers (for example ""Fargo"" 1996) are able to do this job well.

One can also see the film in an entirely different way, namely as a social drama about the gap between rich and poor. In ""Parasite"" the rich and the poor are geographically seperated. The poor are living downhill and the rich are living in the upper parts of town. In film such a setting has ancient origins. Think about a classic as ""Metropolis"" (1927, Frits Lang). The subject of the gap between rich and poor is however still actual (think of the writings of the economist Thomas Piketty). At the same time as ""Parasite"" the latest film of Ken Loach was released (""Sorry, we missed you""). In ""Parasite"" the underdogs of society are not so honest as in ""Sorry, we missed you"" and (controray to the combination crime / comedy) the combination social drama / comedy works well. It makes the film less moralizing.

I like to mention one element in the film that is easily overlooked but has for me a symbolic meaning. At a certain point in the film the masters notice that their servants all have the same stuffy smell. This smell comes from their damp apartment downtown. The symbolic meaning for me was that the servants are judged after their origin and not after their capabilities. In this way there is no upside social potential and the society becomes static. Success is inheritable.

The youngest son of the masters is a bit strange and likes to be in the garden when the rain is pouring. Visually this gives rise to some scenes that made me think of ""Prejudice"" (2015, Antoine Cuypers).","Dec 8, 2019"
7,This movie got this much attention only because of the Oscars,I didn't feel their was enough buildup to justify the abrupt criminal act at the end of the movie. Felt contrived and forced.,"Sep 17, 2021"
7,best International movie/ not best movie,"Curiosity about this film - two families - one very rich and entitled and one very poor with little hope for the future. The poor family appear to be street smart and the rich just more entitled. Slowly the entire family become entwined with the rich based on lie after lie. As the story evolves it become certain that this will not end well - and because of the birthday party, unlike any I have ever seen on screen, that happens. The ending is tragic except for one member - I won't say who. The film is a tragedy on as many levels as there are in the home. The star of the film for me is the home of the rich - confusing writing of the film - one place states it was a set built for the film and another talks about the house as though it was not. I have to be very honest about this film - I would never watch it again. I strongly feel that it probably deserved the international film Oscar. But as for best movie Oscar - no.","Feb 20, 2020"
7,Am I the only one who doesn't get it?,Short and simple review: I had fun watching it but I don't see the greatness. It was somewhat original and the actors did a fine job yet I'm still trying to figure out why it swept the Oscars. Not a bad movie but far from top 100 material.,"May 6, 2020"
7,A Visual Treat,"This film was the winner of the Palme D'Or at Cannes. One can imagine a lengthy standing ovation being given by the elite, wealthy, rich attendees who wished to laud this condemnation of their ilk. Clearly, that is what some reviewers garnered from their viewing of this interesting film. But on the other hand, there are others who view this film as a balancing act, where there is no clear hero or villain. As such, it is a film that asks more questions than it answers.

One thing is certain: this film is a visual treat. Its portrayal of wealthy society and poorer culture pays great attention to detail. Spaces are wonderfully composed and scenes are so well framed, it is tempting to get lost in the visual details.

But there is a story to tell and it is compelling, even if it is sometimes confusing or even inconsistent. The point of view of the director is unclear until the ending. And even then, one wonders about the final lines, which might contradict what has gone before. The best clues to the intent of director Bong Joon Ho are his earlier films, like ""Snowpiercer"" or ""Host"", which feel less ambiguous.","Nov 19, 2019"
7,Was it worthy of an Oscar?,"I haven't left a review on here for ages, but I thought I would have to say something about 'Parasite' as I had to see it on the big screen following it's Oscar win. I had expected 'Once upon a time in Hollywood' ,'The Irishman' or 'Joker' to win best picture or maybe 'Marriage Story' as the outsider.

When 'Parasite' won, it was a shock, but I was glad that a foreign film had won an Oscar even though I had not seen the film. It had to be a great piece to get an Oscar, so I was keen to see it. I saw the film yesterday and have to admit that it was a good film, however I don't believe that it should have been an Oscar winner against the others, it certainly was not a better film than any of the others I have mentioned.

The first half was good, a good black comedic story about envy, scams, can't say any more without spoilers. The second half it drifted into being really silly and became a farce as the script became more and more unbelievable. It is a film that has to be seen, so it is worth the price of a ticket. Maybe I was expecting too much of it!

I am giving it a 7/10, but it could have been a 10/10 had they kept it real.","Feb 19, 2020"
7,Decent movie but does not live up to the hype,"I had high expectations given the raving reviews here. But I have to say, I was disappointed. Fair enough, it is a decent movie with an original plot, but certainly not one of the best films of all time. Not by a long shot.","Mar 9, 2020"
7,Great Film? Sure. Masterpiece? Not So Fast.,"I do recommend this film but it definitely isn't the rip roaring masterpiece you read about comparing it to classics like The Godfather, Casablanca, etc. Why it received so many accolades is beyond me. Probably because it stuck out amongst a sea of mediocre films. The acting was fine. It's the story itself that left a lot to be desired. I really had high hopes going into this one. At least it didn't fall knee deep into the Korean trope of crying crying crying till every handkerchief is dripping wet.","Jan 5, 2020"
7,Good...not great,"Cinematography was amazing in this film. Very good acting.. the plot for me was really weak... I felt like I was watching an episode of Black mirror that was an 1 hour to long. I think this was a little over hyped and overrated. Of all the AMAZING foreign films out there I feel like saying this is ""masterpiece"" is a slap in the face. Still a solid film. I won't watch it again though.","Feb 20, 2020"
7,"Good, but really a masterpiece?","For shure it's a good movie. The production is great ( visual, audio, cut). But the story started great and end up a little flat. Also the critic about capitalism could be sharper.","Oct 27, 2019"
7,What just happened?!?,"This is the worst joke I have ever seen. 😢 When I saw that ""1917"" did not win I just had to watch this. Had such high hopes. I have been a fan of Korean cinema for a while, but this has nothing on Oldboy or even Mother. A win over Mendes' masterpiece just makes the Oscars the worst awards for cinema in the world (which btw was showing for a couple of decades now). Sad! 😢","Feb 10, 2020"
7,Good movie but not great,"The movie is definitely well made and has a good twisted ending but to be honest, it is nothing special. I watched it because of so many great reviews and awards and while I loved the slick way it moved instead of being slow - I have watched enough such movies in Indian cinema to know that it is not a masterpiece.","Feb 14, 2020"
7,Should of been a book instead,All I kept thinking as I watched this film was it should of been a book first vs a movie. The experience would have been more powerful reading it vs seeing it. Hard to rate it honestly.,"Jan 16, 2020"
7,Something is wrong...,"I don't understand why this movie have 8.6, what in hell.... the story was good, nice story elements, acting, but the rest is blank! In middle of the movie it become a little boring, too long, and the end is awkward! A good message but bad conclusion , 7/10 top!","Jan 26, 2020"
7,And again - Overrated,"First off the Movie is absolutely ok, but i can't believe it won an oscar! I think it's a good example of todays influence by the media considering this huge hype and overinterpretation. At least the Movie is polarizing but it's far from a masterpiece - it's ok!","Feb 16, 2020"
7,Twists and turns in somewhat gimmickry ways,"South Korea's leading filmmaker Bong Joon-ho (Memories of Murder, The Host, Mother) shows off his flair and skill once again with his latest entry Parasite. This is an enormously evocative film which creates (and leaves behind) various moods and atmospheres on its way through the inventive, but nevertheless fairly predictable plot which twists and turns in somewhat gimmickry ways. Watching Parasite for the first time is like watching a really clever movie for the second time: you know what will unfold, but you're still quite amazed by the audacity and skill of the presentation. Whether or not you enjoy Parasite on a meta-level, however, will arguably depend on to what degree you make any use of Bong Joon-ho's dab at East-Asian social classes anno 2019. These are not arguments that present themselves logically; they are offered through the absurd behaviour of the movie's two conflicting families - none of whom are sympathetic, even though Mr. Bong ultimately asks us insistently to care for them.","Aug 7, 2023"
7,Good but something lost in translation,"Literally.

First, I always give pause for Cannes films since it's generally over pretentious ""film-viewers"" who think way too deep. It's a freakin' movie.

As a US viewer, the cultural differences, not the class differences, is what got lost in this movie. Some of the social aspect which seemed such taboo are just ""meh"" in the US.

I think if there was an ""Americanized"" version of this, it might ring more true, but I have 0 faith in Hollywood ever making anything good again.","Jan 11, 2020"
7,A bit overrated,"This movie have some very unexpected turns. I found it pretty entertaining to watch. Oscar-worthy? Well, not in my opinion. Don't get me wrong. It's a good movie, not just that good. I found the dialogue between the characters quite exaggerated a lot of the times. All in all, it is a pretty good movie. But not worthy the extreme praise given from a lot of movie critiques, and not really worth the very high rating given here by the users of IMDB.","Feb 11, 2020"
7,"Great movie, conservative plot","Main dichotomies:
Upstairs vs. downstairs
Comedy vs. tragedy
Hope/planning vs. surviving
Believe in work/effort vs. believing in luck or fate (the stone)


Comments:
Ultimately a conservative movie about how bad characters take bad decisions
Key scene where the parasite family is finally all hired and are together in the rich families house alone - and what do they use the time for? They drink eat and mess everything up instead of acting as civilized human beings. They are basically portraited as parasites invading better people's homes and lives.
However, overall a good well-made and unpredictable movie where the characters are not labelled as good or bad but in between a continuum of acting within their means and dreams","Feb 16, 2020"
7,"A difficult film to digest, but a worth reflecting.","Reviewing this movie is a unique challenge for me. As a Japanese person, I've always had a special connection to Asian cinema, even if I haven't always been a fan of the style. My interest in Korean and Japanese movies is often driven by nostalgia rather than a refined taste for the acting and directing styles. It's not that these movies are bad, it's just that my preferences lean elsewhere.

However, there are exceptions. One Korean movie that truly left a mark on me is Oldboy. If you haven't seen it yet, I urge you to skip the Hollywood remake and dive straight into the original. This movie is a visceral experience that will leave you reeling.

The same feeling applies to Parasite. Again, I need to become more familiar with the director and actors. I went to the theater to watch this mainly because of the many praises, awards, and the surprising Oscar nomination for both the Best International Movie and Best Movie categories. Of course, I had to check it out.

When I first sat down to watch Parasite, I had no idea what to expect. The movie starts off like a slice-of-life soap opera, a slow burner that gradually builds tension. But as the story unfolds, the tension escalates, leading to a gripping climax that will keep you on the edge of your seat.

I can't speak too much, not to spoil the surprises and twists. And, oh boy, there are many twists to this plot. It's best to avoid reading anything about the story so you are surprised.

Overall, the directing is superb. The screenplay is not complicated, and it's very well written. The acting is also competent, mixing moments of comedy and tension very well. But, it feels ""dry,"" if it makes any sense.

This is definitely only a movie for some. And as I have minimal exposition to Korean filmmaking, I don't have many other references than Oldboy (and the rest of the Vengeance Trilogy movies, which I'm not too fond of so much). But Oldboy has such a visceral punch that it's hard to forget, even years after I watched it.

Parasite lacks this punch even though the kind of storytelling is similar in a way: a tragedy. Don't get me wrong; it's a very good movie to go see in the theaters. But IMHO, I don't know why this movie is Oscar material. Alas, yes, there are several other nominees, but I also don't understand why they are Oscar material.

From another perspective, for most of the movie, it reminded me of a Tarantino movie. Again, it still needs the punch. But it's textbook Tarantino through and through. The 2nd half is particularly striking and goes super deep into total madness. That's why you want to go to the theater to watch.

I gave Oldboy a very solid 8 out of 10, and I highly recommend you watch it. Parasite is a bit behind, and I think it deserves a solid 7 out of 10.","Jun 2, 2024"
7,Good thriller,Fun thriller and It's got good twist. Nothing mind blowing. Am i shocked this is best picture? yes.,"Feb 29, 2020"
7,"Original, Unconventional and Overrated","When Kim Ki-woo (Choi Woo Shik) is indicated by his best friend, who will travel, as the replacement English tutor of a teenage daughter of the wealthy Park family, he is immediately hired. Soon he foresees the chance to bring his poor unambitious family to work for the family. The Kim family plots a scheme to fire the Park´s driver and the housekeeper and soon his father is hired as driver, his mother as housekeeper and his sister as arts teacher of the wealthy family. When the Park Family travels for camping, they stay in their house as if they were the owners. But soon something happens that will affect the Kim and Park families.

""Gisaengchung"", a.k.a. ""Parasite"", is an original, unconventional and overrated black comedy by the South Korean Bong Joon Ho. The film is good and the plot is funny, dramatic and suspenseful but there is no motive for the hype around this movie. My vote is seven.

Title (Brazil): ""Parasita"" (""Parasite"")","Feb 17, 2020"
7,Slightly overrated movie.,"I watched this movie after reading a lot of rave reviews about it, so that may have played into my impression about the movie. I think it's definitely a good movie in fact one of the memorable ones of 2019, but i still feel the praise this is garnering is slightly overrated for what it offers. The concept is nice. I don't know how the dialogues are in Korean but the English subtitle translation was average and didn't have the comic nature many times. The build up was slow but the movie picks up pace pretty quickly after that. After some shenanigans by the family, the real chaos which is at the heart of the story starts. The frantic events at the end didn't make a lot of sense. I think the end kind of soured overall impression of movie for me, for the sake of keeping review spoiler free I would not say which event exactly but you'd know when you watch it.

Another problem I found was that movie tried to be a lot than what story could have allowed it to be. Comedy thriller would be perfect description but then there are attempts at being a drama movie too and they feel less coherent to the movie... The acting was good by almost every character for the most part. Overall I would say it was a good watch and it is memorable for the uniqueness of the story.","Feb 3, 2020"
7,Mediocre and overrated,"Doesn't take much to please people nowadays! I don't buy the deep, multi-layered metaphorical masterpiece others talk about. It was a fairly simplistic commentary (given the runtime) on social class tensions.

That's it. Interesting plot but I feel it could have been delivered in a much more captivating way. I found the pace excruciating after a while once I understood the general message. Wasted opportunity.

Those giving it a 10 are not on this planet.","Jul 10, 2021"
7,"Mind Wasn't Blown Away, but Good Nonetheless","Not sure about it being the masterpiece that a lot of views claimed it to be, but it was nonetheless captivating to watch. Outrageous plot set in an everyday neighborhood made it seem not so ridiculous but rather interesting to watch. Great cinematography. Always Loved the director's style. And like many other good Asian films, this one definitely stands out from a crowd of CGI packed action Hollywood movies.","Dec 26, 2019"
7,Too ridiculous to be good,"Highly overrated film. Though performances are pretty good, the whole plot and most of the main scenes are so crazy that they take away credibility. Sometimes less is more.","Jan 28, 2020"

With subtitles it was very easy to follow.at few places few sound issues were there. makeup and art direction could have been better. camera and locations worked for the film. all actors were super good. very well done.,"Jan 4, 2021"
7,Not my Movie of the Year,"Of the films in contention this year, I think I would have given Best Director and Best Picture awards to Quentin Tarantino and ONCE UPON A TIME IN HOLLYWOOD - a sly 'revisionist' take on Tinseltown at the far end of its Golden Age. I can see that PARASITE is highly original and filled with ironical social commentary, but Best Picture? Nah.

It's hard to write about it without spoilers, but it's a tale of two Korean families, one rich and living in a hilltop mansion, the other struggling in a grimy basement below the bottom of the same hill. Crafty as well as envious, the poor people slowly (a bit too slowly, IMO) infiltrate the lives of the rich folk. When the plutocrats take off for a camping trip, things start to unravel.

The theme of the working class subverting the Upper Crust was brilliantly explored in Joseph Losey's THE SERVANT (1963), which did not morph from Social Drama into Horror territory. I think PARASITE has to be judged as a horror movie, since that's where it ends up. Set against the standards of Class-A horrors like PSYCHO and THE EXORCIST, I would not put PARASITE in their league. Good, yes, and clever, beautifully shot and edited (and acted), but not up there with The Best. Sorry!","Feb 20, 2020"
7,clever and funny in places but,"Enjoyed this move, smart and with heaps of character. but for me it went downhill in the second half as it went from plausable humour to silly and violent slapstick.","Aug 22, 2020"
7,What the fuss is all about!!!!,"I don't know what the fuss is all about this movie. After I watched the Oscars and to my surprise an Asian film lifting the top prize left me puzzled and at the same time very much excited. I immediately downloaded it and saw it in the middle of the night, the very same day. I won't say it's no good. It is brilliant but Oscar brilliant!!!! That's doubtful.

Our society is not equal and it can never be. That's the fact and we have to live with it. Just imagine a predator and a prey playing equal in mother nature. Chaotic, right?

Very well cinematographed, written, directed and acted but it was just unbelievable to always see rich guys play dumb and easily gullible. They are not like that. And poor and hungry always menacing, opportunistic type which is also stereotypical. Oscars is all about breaking the stereotype but the train has derailed I guess. So disappointed. There were a lot of films better then this one.","Feb 12, 2020"
7,Good not great,It was a really good dark comedy. It was boring in parts. Definitely some flaws. I'd say the 1st half was the better part. It didn't deserve any of the oscars it received. Snow piercer was a better movie by the director and even that didn't deserve any oscars. I love the director though.,"Apr 13, 2020"
7,Hopes and Dreams of a Separated Korea,"I saw this Movie just one day after it won 4 Oscars: Best Motion Picture of the Year, Best Achievement in Directing, Best Original Screenplay and Best International Feature Film. For me it deserves the Oscar for Best International Movie and best Original Screenplay but the best movie of the Year?? CMON... This is the most overated movie of the Decade, it is a good movie sure, with a good Critic to society... Showing the struggle of the classes, the Decay of the Rich who lives their plastic lives, and the Poor that must fight back and rise against opression and Tirany. The problem with the movie, is that it drags in the first 30 minutes, the screentime should be cut to 1h30, 2 hours and 10 minutes is too long... The Dark Humour presented here is really good, and the Climax of the movie, starting with the Flood is also Great. But some of the dialogues in the movie are lacking. The directors work here is really good no doubt, but this movie is after all a Independant Movie with a short budget, with few sets, and some good Twists and Turns in the story... The actors, like almost every Korean movie i've seen, seem authentic and act like real people so they do a very good job. This Movie is a Good One, almost an 8 but the ending could have been better. It is far from a masterpiece, so my review score is a 7 out of 10. P.S: Loved the Critic to Kim Jong Un Regime, the Menace of the Power of a Button is as Powerfull as a Atomic Bomb LOL","Feb 10, 2020"
7,"Entertaining and good, but very overrated","A good movie with an appealing enough plot that has some interesting twists. However, nothing justifies a Best Picture award: No outstanding performances, no memorable soundtrack, not even the sets/photography are good enough to leave a lasting impression. Plain and simple its a solid script that entertains for its duration, with a somewhat critical view of society which people who think of themselves as movie critics will cling on to justify that this movie can win Best Picture award, especially being paired up against Joker and 1917, both of which are vastly superior in every aspect.","Feb 10, 2020"
7,Characters too naïve to be real.,"That sums up it all. When the characters seem to have been made to order, so as to fit the plot no matter what, chances are you won't enjoy the film. You will still be curious to see how it ends, though.","Jan 3, 2020"
7,Yes and No,"Wow! Brilliant yet with some fragmented story lines. Very funny and then alarmingly dark. Found the violence and over the top change in storyline in the last 1/4 of the film difficult to watch and really disliked it. After, I wish I had not watched this film. Very difficult to rate. I guess I am tired of all the violence. So glad though to see a movie made in South Korea come to the mainstream theater here.","Jul 19, 2020"
7,Unique and interesting but overly long,"This movie got so much hype that it's always tough when you go into something with sky-high expectations. I wasn't blown away by the film, as I thought the setup was slow to unravel yet too predictable to maintain that leisurely of a pace, but I did think it did an excellent job of maintaining tension and building the dilemmas and conflict to a point that the whole story becomes so twisted and insane that you're watching it wide-eyed. Good psychological thriller.","Oct 17, 2020"
7,"Good movie, not an 8.6 IMO","Good show, fun ride, quite fresh, definitely not overdone. But at a 8.6 rating, the community is saying it's better than The Green Mile, Whiplash, Interstellar, Gladiator and Terminator 2. I personally do not think it's on that level yet. Maybe its score has to do with how all the indian shows are highly rated on here.","Mar 5, 2021"
7,Reflect the truth of society,"This movie is really reflect the truth of society, not even in Korean but many country around the world.

The story is about the class differences in the society of Korean. The poor people want to have a better life to lived with rich people or be equal to rich people.

It was an interesting movie. Reccommended.

The end of the movie is not something I expected to see.

Eventhought I don't like the end of the story that much but have to admitted that this is a good movie, it was something new worthing for the reward.

The gab between rich and wealthy people and poor people was really real thing.","Jul 27, 2023"
7,Watchable,"For me it's not worth the hype and not Oscar worthy at all.

The story is good but the execution is far from great.

The characters are not developed enough for you to sympathize with any of them. For example you have no context and never get to know the personality of the son in the poor family which is just one of the main characters.

The acting is exaggerated and shallow and leaves you wondering if it's supposed to be a comedy but then it doesn't get to be funny. On the other hand many reviews say it's a thriller, but it never made me care what happens if they are caught.

Some parts are also very implausible, for example in the final scenes, where people randomly live / die independently of the severity of the injuries.

Then there's the social inequality theme. Low income people are portrayed as the scammers, so I wasn't able to sympathize with them.

Couldn't rate it higher than 7.","Jan 28, 2024"
7,Dark City,"This is a bravura and surprising thriller, with a fancy modernist brutalist house as one of the leading stars. There is little doubt that as a loser family start to target a rich household, their early success cannot hold.

I'm a fan of Korean films anyway, and so was relaxed about the various styles this film goes through. While the film is totally accessible, there are still enough references to Korean and Asian society to make it a little demanding on the viewer - which is why the Oscar success was nicely surprising.

The film does not perfectly handle it's different layers - the political message and the moral message rather wrap around each other awkwardly. The pacing doesn't always work either - the direction is relaxed in the house but pokes around nervously outdoors.

This is not the best Korean film I've seen - Old Boy and I saw the Devil were superior - but the setup, cinematography and the sheer chutzpah of the plotting make it a sharp witted success. (I don't reference the classic Old Boy accidentally; that too was effectively a double layered film, and on reflection it was a little better at it.)","Feb 22, 2020"
7,I just do not get it,"First time i tried to see it was in the cinema, and it didnt take too long for me to leave. In 2022, gave it another shot and said im not giving up this time. I watched it completely. I just dont get all the hype around it. This film deserves a 7 only beacuse of cinematography and maybe acting. But Oscars? Only beacuse its a movie from Asia? Political decision. This movie is OK, but far away from others. This is a 8.5 rating, just like Whiplash, a movie far greater than this one. Maybe it just doesnt fit my taste, but as i am seeing trough this section, i am not the only one with the same opinion.","May 25, 2023"
7,The movie was entertaining but not Oscar-worthy,"I found the movie entertaining. I was expecting more duplicity and schemes from the Kim family once they infiltrated the rich family. It moved slow at first but picked up pace towards the middle.

7,A brilliant work of art,"A movie that not only highlights the difference between the upper economy class and the lower economy class but also wraps around the emotions associated when two classes meet at some point.

If you are looking to watch something that's realistic, including drama, story, and emotions, PARASITE is one such movie. No spoilers, but it will leave a lasting impact in recognizing the everyday struggle of the earning member belonging to a lower middle class and how he has to go through tons of emotions hiding the pain from his family members.

While also, how such people aspire to become similar to the ones they are working for.","Sep 3, 2023"
7,Found A Job,"I enjoyed this movie. It had some surprises in it, and I really couldn't predict where it was going to end up. It was extremely well made and well written, and the performers all did a great job. I guess the ending bothered me a little bit, but I'll admit it helped to reinforced what the movie was trying to say.","Mar 31, 2020"
7,Overrated,"This movie is nice and the idea is interesting, but it's not the best movie of 2019, it's totally overrated.","Feb 23, 2020"
7,A sharp social commentary wrapped in thrilling drama,"""Parasite,"" directed by Bong Joon-ho, is a masterful blend of dark comedy, social commentary, and thrilling drama. The film follows the impoverished Kim family as they con their way into working for the wealthy Park family, leading to unexpected and shocking consequences.

The film's greatest strength lies in its storytelling. Bong Joon-ho skillfully balances humor and tension, keeping the audience engaged and on edge throughout. The screenplay is sharp and layered, offering biting commentary on class disparity and social inequality without being preachy.

The performances are stellar across the board. Song Kang-ho, as the Kim family patriarch, delivers a nuanced performance, while the rest of the cast, including Choi Woo-shik and Park So-dam, bring depth and authenticity to their roles.

Visually, ""Parasite"" is stunning, with meticulous attention to detail in its production design. The contrast between the Kims' cramped basement home and the Parks' luxurious mansion is striking and symbolic.

However, some viewers might find the film's tonal shifts jarring, and its ending, while impactful, may not satisfy everyone. Despite these minor issues, ""Parasite"" is a thought-provoking and well-crafted film that leaves a lasting impression. It's a unique cinematic experience that challenges and entertains in equal measure.","May 27, 2024"
7,I think a bit of virtue signalling has surfaced here...,"Please stop with all this ""best film ever made"" rubbish. No one can see your profile, you're anonymous, it's pointless. It's not bad. I have no idea how well its acted as I can't speak Korean. And I'm guessing, neither can most here. They could be hammy as heck for all I know. It's quite original, and certainly well scripted. It's also a little far fetched. Well, a lot actually. Listen, it is good. Is it gonna make you rethink ""world cinema"" (ridiculous term)? Not if it was never on your radar.","Feb 18, 2020"
7,A Solid Movie.,"Parasite is a very good movie for a one time viewing if you're in need for a flick to watch and enjoy. That being said I don't rate it as highly as most critics.

The characters where my favourite aspect as there was almost no (if any) characters I thought where out of place and/or didn't fit.

The story and world that was created for the movie was absolutely fine and isn't like any other movie I have seen before it. I liked the premise, it had me interested and semi-hooked straight away. Although it's definitely not handled perfectly.

That brings us to the ending. The ending was by far (for me) the worst part of the movie. The last maybe 15-20 minutes where a disaster knocking the movie down from a 8/10 to a 7/10. Also the former maids character and the stuff around her (which I won't get into for spoiler reasons) I though took away but just not as much as that ending.

I did however love how they showed the poor family and although not as much I also like how the rich family where represented. Although I'm not sure how accurate to reality it is (which I assume it is accurate). I believe it at the very least did the job you would need for a movie of this elk. Great work in this department.

Cast - 9.5/10

Story - 7/10

Action (although not very important) - 3.5/10

The World - 8/10

Overall a very good watch but not as impressive as people give it credit for in my eyes.

Solid Movie - 7/10.","Jun 5, 2022"
7,Enjoyable but not a classic,"The start and end felt rushed, but the film was generally enjoyable. Not sure why it was hyped quite so much, but definitely worth a watch, but it's unlikely to be a film I return to watch again.","Oct 9, 2021"
7,Smart comedy,"""Parasite"" is a smart, highly entertaining black comedy, and it's good to see a good film getting some recognition for once. However, I feel like all the people who praised it as an absolute masterpiece and one of the best films of all times must have been watched ""Transformers"" and ""Avengers"" all their life. The film itself is solid in most aspects, but conceptually I don't buy the cheap social critique and easy populism that one more time depicts the rich as spoiled, dumb, and not worthy of their wealth. Perfect food for the envious middle-class that dreams of living in big houses, driving expensive cars. Retrospectively, the last season has been full of this kind of ""us vs. Them"" films, and while ""Parasite"" might actually be the only one to be any good, it's not thanks to its message.

Actually, it would have been alright if the movie ended with the party scene without all that subsequent melodramatic crap to glorify the working class who ""lost"" gain. Up to that point, both families are almost equally ambiguous, with even some interesting reflections on how this generation's weak spot for resonant brand names and exclusivity, as even the humblest servant now is supposed to have a resume full of renowned names or belong to elite companies to get a job. The vertical depiction of society is also effective in its simplicity, with the Parks' physically living above everything else, but at the same time unable to see what lies beneath due to the high walls and trees that entirely cover the view from their garden. The layout of their house also mirrors this verticality with rooms and hallways they are not even aware of.

An above-average film overall but definitely no masterpiece, not even Boon Joon-ho's best.","Aug 24, 2021"

7,Decidedly reactionary,"In a hurry, I finally saw Parasite and it wasn't sooo great. I was not convinced by his grotesque / black comedy style, certain repetitions, some too long scenes, his low blows and some formal gloating.

Visually brilliant.","Jan 3, 2021"
7,Nice but can be improved,"It's a nice movie overall. I personally like this type of movie; it has the elements that I like, e.g. the contrast between the poor and the rich- their different living conditions and lifestyles. However, I would like to see more locations rather than just between the two places where the two families live. I would also like to see more interactions between those in the underground hiding and those living in the house, something like The Hidden Face, with more suspense and a better twist.","Oct 13, 2020"
7,Too much hype,"This movie is moderately good. I can't believe how it won Oscars. It won even feature in that top 20-30 movies I have seen. There is too much hype around it.

7,Actions reveal Character,"This film is an amazing work of dramatic art. The acting is first rate. The cinematography is state of the art. Beautifully filmed!

The ending is very challenging because the viewer likely finds the Kim family very charming. As the charming underdogs, they are easy to like. As they suffer from terrible poverty and misfortune, they are easy to gain sympathy. The viewer will make excuses for their many lapses of character. But here is the point: they are evil people. Do not look at their intentions, but look at their actions. Look at the choices that they make. They are foul-mouthed criminals. They are consumed by envy. They have no moral restraints.

The many victims of the evil Kim family are not portrayed as especially admirable people, so it can be easy to overlook the morality play that is being portrayed. It's okay for them to suffer because the audience is sympathizing with the Kims. Besides, the crimes against them are portrayed comedically. The audience laughs with the Kims as they commit their crimes. Until the full measure of the tragedy unfolds. What appeared to be a comedy, is revealed to be an awful tragedy. The trap has been sprung and the viewer has been judged with the guilty.

It's a great work of art. Unpleasant, but thought-provoking.","Aug 9, 2020"
7,Simple,"Sincerely I found it like a slice-of-life thing with some humor and at the end some drama. Nothing more. I think that this movie is mainly psychological, not proper a thriller. Anyway it can be a good movie to watch (but not the best).

The actors are good, much better than those ones that you can see in Korean TV shows (personally I find them pretty awkward and acting-exaggerated). The soundtrack can be appreciate.

This movie is about the difference between poor and rich. In particular the struggling of poor people to live.

I can't get why it is so appreciate and famous, maybe is me that I didn't get the hidden message or something? I think that I have to search on internet some information about it...","Aug 31, 2020"
7,Good but Not Great,Best movie of the year full of suspense and white knuckle moments is the hype. Not the reality. A unique story that misses a lot of opportunities in it's execution. A highly unsatisfying ending. Lots of loose ends. Didn't live up to the hype at all. An enjoyable watch but less suspenseful as The Hand That Rocks the Cradle.,"Jun 5, 2020"
7,It's entertaining but overestimated.,"I already saw the comment on capitalism and the other layers of human nature and relationships other times in other films. I'm not saying it's a bad movie, maybe that's on me and my expectations.","Jul 9, 2021"
7,Different viewpoint,"Despite the positive reviews of the film critics, it didn't inspire me much. Honestly, after watching it, it was hard for me to imagine how this film won Oscar and other awards. Both in terms of technical aspects, as well as the characterization and the way the story was told, I believe it was an ordinary film. Therefore, I would give it 60 out of 100. The only thing I liked was the story itself and its message for the audience, regardless of attention to professionalism in storytelling. During the film, I was waiting for a scene passionate and influential but I couldn't get it. However, I suggest you watch it. It worths doing that. Happy New year 🙂","Dec 31, 2020"
7,A Black Comedy That Takes a Sinister Turn,"Parasite

Overall a very enjoyable movie.

This started out a black comedy and by the end morphed into something more sinister. We were shown a close knit nuclear family scraping by to survive in a slum-type basement dwelling. They were all universally hard working, inventive and inspired to get on in life, however it was inferred by the script that these attributes were not enough for any social mobility and that any advancement within Korean society was wholly dependent on the possession of family money from the outset.

The Director introduced several themes and ideas that he tossed around, never quite landing on any definitive conclusion. We, the viewers were the mouse and the Director the cat. It did strangely have the feel of an Almodovar movie, perhaps this style was an influence.

Lastly the obvious intention by the Director to infer wealthy people are parasites due to wealthy inequality was handled badly as it is these very wealthy people that provide currently any wages or opportunity for the poor. The real parasite is the Korean government who collect the taxes and make the laws and have clearly failed to create welfare structures or free education to promote a better society and social mobility. What would happen if all the wealthy people left and there was no tax receipts and communism has certainly not proved the answer.

What was good

The family bonds were well established, they were all in this together. This very much held the movie together.

This was very much a simple linear story and most refreshing in its delivery.

There was, for the first two thirds of the movie great dramatic impetus, we were all gripped, and I could certainly feel quite an atmosphere in the picture house.

The acting seemed competent from the entire ensemble but it was difficult to judge due to the barrier of the subtitles.

The subtitles were nuanced and comprehensive and seemed entirely natural.

The cinematography was great and the camera made us feel very much the fly on the wall, and very in keeping with this kind of story.

The musical score was great.

What was problematic

The Director inferred that wealth and opportunity were the way forward and a wholesome aspiration for advancement for the family, but then went onto infer wealth corrupts and perhaps the mere possession of wealth was obscene, this is muddled thinking as it cannot be both as the same time.

It was inferred that wealth isolates and anaesthetises you from the realities of other people lives, but the script so over simplified this observation it became irrelevant.

We had insufficient character separation they are were just voices of the Director.

It was inferred that oppression leads to revolution, I agree, but the family were not oppressed at the moment or indeed previously they were on the way up, so revolution, and this instigation for a bloodbath was flimsy.

I enjoyed this movie, it lost its way in the last half hour and arrived at little redemption or conclusion. It really had little to say on the human condition, however it's great strength lay in its inventive comedy.

With regard to awards, I would nominate it for best foreign language movie and give the award to Pain & Glory by Almodovar.","Jan 25, 2020"

7,best picture? not sure,"A film with a not very specific style. Average acting power, not so good screenplay, good direction, and overall an interesting and good movie, but not to the extent that the Oscar will give it the best picture. There were really better options to win in the movies of 2019. There are sequences in the movie that the viewer has no connection with and are just for the continuation of the movie, things happen that are not logical at all and the dialogues are extremely basic. I emphasize that the movie is a good movie for Korean cinema, but not to the extent of winning an Oscar. In the previous years, there have been much better movies in Korean cinema that did not receive any Oscar, such as Oldboy or Lady Vengeance. In general, I don't have anything else to say, I don't know, maybe I have a low cinema sense.","Aug 20, 2023"
7,Good Film. But......,"Good film but way too many plot holes or grandiose surreal situations. The social theme was great to show the difference between lower and upper class, while maintain equal footing and save face when they met. When the driver got fired for adult act presumed , why wasn't she dismissed ? - this fell flat to be satisfactory answered. The rich family even thought possibility of drugs ..but kept her on? The movie should of ended for her there. Why was the ex-house maid husband stuck down there without any knowledge of rich family. Seemed far fetch and same when main actor father went down there. Flicking light would of been fixed or traced to underground passage. Numerous other questions but too long to write.

Many scene reflect Korean social problem, for example disparity, diplomaism and so on . Because of these, this movie could be a unique, not following American ones.So i can assent on that this was awarded Oscar, one of the most authoriative movie award.

This is not related to evaluation, i noticed that Korean people use english in their daily conversation more frequently than Japanese. I heard that the importance of English is acknowledged in Korea recently, so many parents make their child to learn English in his childhood. I guess that these condition appeared in this movie.","May 4, 2020"

7,Gisaengchung,"Art, music, completion and drama conflict are all wonderful and impeccable. This play is a carefully crafted work of art, but I don't particularly like it emotionally.

7,Sad,"Originally, the Kinkize family survived quietly, poor and undignified and without any hope. However, taking advantage of an accidental opportunity, the Kinkize family gradually drove away and replaced all the former servants of the chief family of Park Society. After becoming the new servant of President Park's family, the material quality of the Kinkize family improved rapidly. (after making money, the Kinkize family became stronger than before and dared to go up and teach them a lesson in the basement where they lived. The drunk man who peed on it). Moreover, the President and his family are very good people, are quite polite to the Jin family, and are full of service to the Jin family. Sounds like a harmonious story that each side needs. However, President Park's politeness and satisfaction with Kim Keze are premised on, that is, Kinkize cannot cross the line. In a modern society that promotes equality for all, everyone generally maintains superficial equality and respect. This family would never think of a poor proletariat. A man is equal to himself, just like a slave The master and aristocrat will never think of slaves as slaves Li, civilians and themselves are equal.Yeah. The realistic status and life of the two Convince both sides that each other is by no means equal.Wait. President Park has nothing to do with Kim Keze.To make it clear, but to ask Kim Keze to abide by it consciously. The most important rule of the year is: no, no.

7,review of cisaengchung,"As the plot progresses, the differences between the two families become more apparent and the concept of ""parasite"" becomes more acute.Bong joon-ho's genre films are remarkably transparent, part modern fable and part family drama from a distance, while up close they oscillate between satire, dark comedy and thriller, deftly managing transitions and shifts in style.Uzan's big house has played a huge role in spatial design and vertical positioning -- highlighting the upper and lower classes of society.The use of stair, window, insect, rainwater, sewage also is very advanced.As the name suggests, bong joon-ho once again proves that genre films are real movies, and that popularity is closely related to the author.","Mar 18, 2020"
7,Sad life,"The allegory of Parasite is well understood by everyone. The rich live in a big house and enjoy a prosperous life. The poor live in a semi-basement, exuding the smell of poverty. The poor imagine that they can also be the masters of the big house , Can also climb relatives of the upper class, but do not know that there is a more desperate place in the underground of the mansion, the bottom floor does not see the sun, live a cockroach-like life, the upward path has been sealed, and the downward path is like a black hole Clutching you like that. The film shows an almost epitome of life in a contemporary society in an almost absurd and desperate style. At the bottom, the upper class is a kind of almost Stockholm-like worship, but resent the poor who live better than him. The dream of breaking the class barriers shattered and fell into the abyss of fate, but the son dreamed of buying that house so that one day his father could walk up from the ground and into the sun. The plot of his son's letter was filled with the most desperate emotion in the film. We all know that this is impossible, they are Sisyphus pushing the stone up the mountain, they are destined to be trapped in this fate.","May 1, 2020"
7,"I always believe that if the ending is not happy, it must be not enough to feel life","It's a pity that Parasite is attacking inequality with the poor's wrong face and choice. This is probably the reason why I have not been able to truly accept this film, because it is really uncomfortable to think deeper. The structure and technique of the film are shocking, but the idea behind it is really difficult to understand. If you want to say what it makes people think about, it should be the most basic respect between people. No matter what class, status, or situation, you can really treat the other person as a person, not those inferior ones.","Mar 15, 2020"
7,Equilibrium Art,"Every detail of the film is in the hands of the director with incredible precision, presenting an absurd social fable that is easy to dismiss as bloody-eyed. Audiences will be fascinated by the plot of the film, and they can easily understand the class gap presented by the film. Bong jun-ho USES techniques to largely eliminate the absurdity of the story into absurdity. It has the halo of the palme d 'or of cannes, but it has no cinema threshold, which is the ideal result of balanced art.","Mar 18, 2020"

I watched this before all the hype exploded and the movie went mainstream and thought nothing much of it at the time. I enjoyed it though, it was a great story and very well made, but didn't think it worthy of all the hype. I went to see it again after all the hullabaloo and didn't really think anything different for the first time. I didn't miss anything and I still 'get' it.

7,Well made movie with a thoughtful screenplay,"PARASITE (2019)

A tale of the uneasy relationship between the classes, a tale of identity and of desire. This morality play explores that even with a plan man is destined to remain caged and immobile no matter the social and economic aspirations. The story has been told before but Korean director Bong Joon Ho ratches things up a bit, especially in the film's climactic ending. The lower class Kims are masters at manipulation and lying to get ahead and benefit working for a naive wealthy family. Yet sadly the Kim's never advance. The class struggle moves into poor against poor before dissolving into all out chaos between the classes. The director keeps a good distance from the characters painting them in broad strokes. The story ends violently, yet tragically it appears that nothing has really changed. One man confined to hiding in the cellar is simply replaced by another and the futile dream of social and economic advancement continues. I often wondered while watching this film if PARASITE was the correct translation of the title. For me, the class relationships in this film are more symbiotic, each class needing the other to survive. So who or what is the parasite? For the director it is hope: that longing that burrows under the skin that you can't get rid of. This is a well made movie with a thoughtful screenplay that has a natural forward movement to it. There is an artistic, art-house metaphoric quality to it (such as a rock is both a totem and a weapon), but I don't think it is the masterpiece many claim it to be. The movie plays out very straightforward, more like a made for tv mini series. An excellent three-parter perhaps. The production is great and the actors are terrific, parts of it quite funny. However, for me this is a good movie, not a masterpiece nor Oscar best picture worthy. I rate PARASITE 7/10.","Aug 7, 2020"
7,I don't get it,"It was entertaining, with good execution. But best picture?

Some people seem to love the fact that it switches masterfully between genres, which to me seems like something that would excite a movie geek or critic more than it would a regular viewer.

Others delight in the ambiguity of not quite knowing whom to root for - while that might distinguish it from a stereotypical ""american"" narrative it hardly elevates it to some exalted status. To its credit, I think the strongest feature of the film is that the director brilliantly manipulates the viewer's emotions by superimposing classically sympathetic elements onto the objectively non-virtuous and indeed villainous. What seems relatable and sympathetic in the moment is actually part of a pattern of deeply objectionable behavior, while what seems moderately dislikable is actually fairly mundane. This incongruity is layered on to brilliant effect.

Now, many are praising the supposedly deep, revelatory social commentary on the nature of class struggle, but I don't find it nearly as profound as is claimed. The overtly sensational, absurd plot if anything detracts from the relatability of a social message, and the storyline (even leaving aside the over-the-top scenes that are exaggerated for cinematic effect) is chock full of innumerable ordinary lapses, discontinuities and implausibilities to the point of distraction. More importantly, the characters are all minimally developed and characteristic of a one-sided view of the world in which people act out their base grievances and fantasies over a veneer of class-determinant normalcy. It strikes me that there is little to no consideration of virtue, even in momentary antithesis. Yet if this is the social revelation then it is a deeply cynical one, and also an implausible one because the world is not so one-sided and simple. For this reason, the film ends up revealing very little realistic insight into the human character or social dynamics. It is not a bad film as it is well executed and clever in its emotional manipulation, but I am not willing to dole out gushing praise.","Apr 12, 2020"

7,Good movie but why the hype,"The story was really good and enjoyable but, it was kinda a let down knowing how much people hyped this movie. It won so many awards but why. It was not that shocking at all. But the best part about it was the acting and cinematography.

If you want to watch a really crazy mind blowing movie you should watch Old Boy. It's another Korean film that deserved more praise than this movie.","May 13, 2020"
7,"Great Story Telling, but Best Picture?","The story telling, and general themes of the movie work and are worth its praise. However, I don't see how it won best picture with other aspects such as cinematography being good, through not amazing.

The movie is enjoyable, though not for everyone. There are some light comedic moments, introspective reflections, and evening some thriller surprises. The movie works, but I can't say it was the best picture I saw from 2019.","May 9, 2020"
7,Interesting mix of genres,It's hard to define the genre of this movie. It starts as a subtle and enjoyable comedy before veering into overdone goriness. Reminded me of Chinese cinema of the 70ies. The theme of the movie is quite interesting and seems to be preoccupying more Korean directors (cfr. Burning from Chang-dong Lee) : the abusive crossing of social class lines... Too bad for the ending. My rating would have been higher would that have been subtle too. Still the movie is good and enjoyable.,"Oct 21, 2019"
7,"""It doesn't ends well but still worth to watch""","Parasite movie has its elements of comedy , drama and thrilling but not satisfying at the end because It takes a dark turn at the end which was still nice if the production was going to end that way ...

I didn't get it.. So good movie to watch but at the end it gets too depressing to watch the ending No justice done there.","Mar 29, 2020"

7,Creditable: its good but not great,"This doesn't seem like an oscar - winning picture. There is no doubt of the good acting delivered by the actors ; each characters has its own personality and the plot is twisting enough.

It just ain't oscar- wrothy!","Mar 19, 2020"
7,"Decent, but Over-Hyped","I came here to say that the movie is decent, but getting pretty goddam overrated. It's a perfectly good watch, the plot revolves around a poor family worming their way into a rich household by getting the employees fired, but at this point, it won the Palm D'or at Cannes, Best picture and Best Foreign Picture at the Academy Awards, and no doubt collected a whole slew of other trophies and ribbons and participation prizes and good-job stickers pretty much everywhere else, but at some point enough is enough. It's good. Hell, it's perfectly decent. But it's quickly becoming one of the most over-rated movies of the past half-decade. ""Masterpiece!"" calm down, a little early to call it. give it some time. ""Phenomenal"", ""Amazing!"", ""Astounding!"", ""breathtaking!"", ""It cured blindness!"", ""It made my cancer recede!"". Every year you get that sort of movie and morons jumping on the bandwagon without giving it some space first. It's a likeable movie, but it seems like it could become one of those cases where it's gradually soured by the obnoxious fan-base overdoing it. Give it a watch, sure, but take the opinions of the easily-impressed with a grain of salt.","Feb 11, 2020"

But what ever happened during that second half of this movie... I have no idea how this mediocre movie got so many main Oscar nominations. It ain't worth that, plot is nonsense and no matter how much I want, I can't justify it.

7,"Strange movie, but a good one.","This is a dark comedy, no question about it. But is also an almost surreal movie. Very clever thought. This is the kind of movie that a lot of people want to do and fail badly. So if you are into dark comedy, strange movie, give it a go.","Oct 22, 2019"
7,Very good movie,"This is a very good movie, but not a masterpiece. I really like the story and the actors were pretty good. I would never expect this film to win an Oscar. I guess the politics has entered the Oscars for good. I understand that many will not agree with me, but this is my personal opinion.","Feb 15, 2020"
7,"Ethics, poverty, and suspense","I managed to not know much about this before watching. Was genuinely surprised by a few plot twists, and was at the edge of my seat or holding my breath for many moments, with many laughs at the believable absurdity in between. In the end, I felt this was a thought-provoking commentary on the desperation and feelings of being trapped experienced by many in poverty.","Apr 27, 2020"
7,A tad underwhelming.,"A down-on-their-luck, low-class family con their way into the employ of a rich household, but events turn sinister after they find a secret in the basement.

Maybe I've just seen too many really messed up movies from the far East, but at the half-way point of Parasite, which sees the discovery of a hidden bunker and an unexpected inhabitant lurking within, I hoped that matters would get seriously twisted in the way that only Asian cinema can; but while things certainly get dark, the film is not nearly as edgy, or as bizarre, or as wild as the premise suggests.

The initial plot twists and turns are deftly handled by director Bong Joon-ho, there are some superbly executed scenes of tension, the performances are great, the cinematography is lovely, and the film's social commentary on how different classes view and treat each other allows for plenty of delicious satire, but the second half of the film still feels frustratingly restrained in terms of sheer audacity. Restrained, and incredibly drawn out, Bong Joon-ho letting too many scenes drag their heels, with the ending taking an eternity to arrive.

In short, definitely worth a watch, but a serious contender for best picture? Surely not.","Jan 25, 2020"
7,It was pretty good.,"The movie was well written, well acted, well paced, well filmed, well scored. Everything was pretty good. For me, it is a far cry from the best film I've seen. It might not even be in the top 10. Don't get me wrong. It was a very good movie worth watching, and worth watching on the big screen. I don't really get the masterpiece and best film ever comments. It was entertaining and thought provoking. Go see it, but ignore the super reviews as well as the bad reviews.","Feb 1, 2020"
7,schemes & smell of poor,"The movie Parasite directed by Bong Jon Ho focuses on rich and poor, haves and have-notes. Unemployed and poor Kim-ki taek and his wife Moon-gwang live in very small apartment with their 2 smart young kids, son Kim ki-woo and daughter Kim ki-Jung who will go to any part, any height of apartment to get WiFi/internet connection. The conversation between son Kim ki-woo and his friend Min who wants him to tutor a rich girl Park Da-hye is very touching . Min sees Kim ki-woo as a weak competitor and prefers him to his smart, rich friends who may make advances on Park Da-hye. Then pretty, smart daughter Kim-ki Jung starts teaching Art to rich girl's younger brother Park Da-song. With lies and deceit, the 4 members of poor family end up working in same beautiful rich house owned by successful young man Park Dong-ik and his beautiful , simple wife Park Yeon-kyo. Differences between the rich and poor and the conversations between rich husband and wife describing smell from their new chauffeur are very touching. The constant reminder of class distinction keeps reinforcing humiliation and disrespect of the rich for the poor and the 4 family members from poor background lose control. Excellent Direction even though the story is far fetched. Entire cast did very well. 2hrs 12 minutes too long. Really got bored with story.","Jan 23, 2020"
7,Lacks any realistic human dimension,"South Korean director Bong Joon-ho (""Okja"") says that he always tries to overturn viewer expectations and hopes that his latest film succeeds in this way. Palme d'Or winner at the 2019 Cannes Film festival, Bong's Parasite (Gisaengchung) does indeed thwart expectations, but the question is - to what end? Defying any strict genre classification, the film is a conglomeration of comedy, drama, satire, crime, horror, and anything else you can throw into the mix. Bong sees the film as a statement about the ""ranks and classes"" inherent in capitalism that are invisible to the eye, and says that the film ""depicts the inevitable cracks that appear when two classes brush up against each other in today's increasingly polarized society."" Unfortunately, the characterizations are filled with so many stereotypes that the lack of any realistic human dimension leaves Bong's statement without much impact.

The film looks at class differences between two families - one well-to-do, and the other n'eer do well. For the Kim family, life is a struggle. They live in a cramped bug-infested basement apartment without many amenities except for a toilet built on kind of a shelf. The father Ki-taek (Song Kang-ho, ""Snowpiercer"") has failed in business and has accumulated many debts. His son and daughter Ki-woo (Choi Woo-sik, ""Train to Busan"") and Ki-jung (Park So-dam, ""Cinderella and Four Knights"" TV series) have repeatedly failed college entrance exams. The mother Chung-sook (Hyae-jin Jang, ""Adulthood"") along with the two children fold boxes for a delivery company, but cannot even get that right. Not to worry, they leave their windows open when the fumigators come around to get some free extermination and steal free Wi-Fi from the next door coffee shop.

On the other hand, the nouveau riche Park family has all the advantages. Mr. Park (Lee Sun-kyun, ""Jo Pil-ho: The Dawning Rage"") is the CEO of a high-tech company and the family lives in a spacious, modernistic home protected by sturdy concrete walls. He has an attractive somewhat fragile wife Yeon-kyo (Jo Yeo-jeong, ""The Target""), a teenage daughter Da-hye (Jung Ji-so, ""The Tiger""), and a hyper-active young son Da-song (Jung Hyun-jun). Being wealthy and somewhat elitist in their attitude, for Bong, they are ideally suited to be torn apart by ruthless grifters. With the aid of a friend, Ki-woo is hired to be a private tutor for Da-hye. Of course, he has to forge university documents to convince the trusting Mrs. Park of his competence. With that conquest out of the way, the cunning Ki-woo concocts a scheme to secure jobs in the Park household for his entire family.

Convinced that their young son is a budding Picasso, Mrs. Park hires Ki-jung as an art teacher, then falls for invented stories impugning the character of their driver and housekeeper to provide some more employment opportunities for the Kims, this time for the deadbeat dad Ki-taek and his wife Chung-sook. Bong said that ""Sometimes with the characters in my films, I look at them cynically, but most of the time I have a lot of compassion for the characters, even with the villains."" This compassion, however, does not seem to extend to the loyal, hardworking household workers, their work scammed out of existence. Without going into detail, the whole escapade backfires in a twist that is over-the-top unsettling even though utterly implausible.

Worthy of a Mack Sennett comedy, a sweet family drama turns into a tumultuous melange of hidden chambers, revenge, bloody violence, a torrential rainstorm, people hiding under beds, and any other mayhem that may come to mind. To be clear, Parasite can be very funny and some of the satire is sharp-edged, yet it is hardly, as one critic described it, ""a masterful dissection of social inequality."" When asked what he wanted viewers to get out of the film, Bong said, ""I just hope that it gives audiences a lot to think about. It is in parts funny, frightening, and sad, and if it makes viewers feel like sharing a drink and talking over all the ideas they had while watching it, I'll wish for nothing more."" Enjoy the drink. In a little while, you may have trouble remembering what the film was about.","Oct 15, 2019"
7,Enjoyable comedy with some twists,"A poor family works their way into the lives, and the pockets, of a rich one.

I enjoyed the movie and there are many good comedic moments and the families dramas are well played out. The shock ending isn't shocking because you've been warned by the cinema rating, 'strong bloody violence,' but there are still some surprises. It's typical of the better non-English films that make it into the English-speaking cinemas: quirky and original.

You'll have heard all the reviews that say, 'I won't spoil what happens but, a poor family con their way into becoming the servants of a rich family.' Well; that's all that happens. How they get there is very entertaining and there are some twists but there's not much else to the story. It's good but not a ""perfect movie."" Palme d'Or ok, Oscar what?

I liked, 'Do it clockwise.'","Feb 21, 2020"
7,Well executed but what for?,"Just seen the film. Yes, it is good piece of cinematography. Telling story of different worlds people live in. Separate social bubbles. But what afterthoughts do we have while leaving the cinema?

""The rich get richer and the poor get poorer""? Obvious truths. Nothing new we didn't knew about. Sterile environment of upper class, cockroach life of underprivileged. Dullness of these which have and hopelessness of these which don't. Characters without depth put into roles they were born into.

Some symbolism justifying incostinant and improbable plot, but is there enough reason for its application? I see very little.","Feb 14, 2020"
6,"deep, complicated, all in one","I liked this movie for being very deep and complicated in story, while not being so much unclear. It just explains us realistic and possible real life complicated situations. Emotional, funny, realistic, serious, religious, moral, teaching, but negative. Also interesting insight into Korean culture and behavior. The only thing that makes this movie bad is that it is too negative, and especially negative ending. Teaches us about instability of life, greed, desperation, survival, crime. Worth an oscar at least because of its depth or because of seriousness of topics or lessons. Not good to watch for those sensitive to scary and difficult realistic situations like getting hurt, imprisoned, etc.","Jan 3, 2021"
6,An OK movie,It was OK. Not sure what's the fuzz around it tho. Slow paced drama/triller with very little plot and excitment. Felt pretty boring most of the time.,"Feb 29, 2020"
6,I thought this movie was overrated,"I liked Bong Joon-ho's The Host, didn't care for Snowpiercer, and while I thought Parasite was decent, I definitely don't consider it the best movie of 2019, nor did it live up to the hype I heard beforehand. I however don't think there's some conspiracy by the Academy Awards or other American institutions to put international movies above American ones for some sort of ""social justice"", and I'm perfectly OK with them choosing an international movie if they just think it was the best movie of the year. There's been a few years in my time where I thought a non-American movie was better than the American-made ones that year.

I was initially excited to see the movie, especially after hearing some hints of what it was about, and that it was a dark and stunning psychological take on people of different classes. I think class disparity is a huge problem in our country, so it felt very relevant. I also love dark psychological movies, but unfortunately after seeing this, I realized it wasn't that dark and wasn't that psychological. While it explores class disparity, neglect, and cruelty, there's so many problems with both the protagonists (if you can call them that) and antagonists (if that's really what they were).

The movie's biggest flaws are mostly in presentation, but some of the situations and actions of the characters are preposterous and feel very contrived. It's a riveting watch, is fairly well acted and directed, memorable, and has interesting situations, but too many times I had to suspend disbelief to an almost comical degree. The movie does have dark humor, which I appreciated, but I think some of it is unintended. This reminded me of Snowpiercer, as that had so many preposterous situations that I couldn't help but laugh. I think this is almost a signature of Bong Joon-ho, which worked well in The Host, but not so much in these other two movies. I haven't seen Mother, so I'm not sure if it's truly a common or intentional thread in his movies. I've enjoyed a lot of Korean movies, but I think Joon-ho may be overrated at this point.

I also think some of the violence is unnecessary and for shock value, and gets a bit overly-explicit, and some character's reaction to it is a bit odd and from my perspective a bit unbelievable and sometimes comes off as contrived. It seems in these more odd situations, Joon-ho is trying to make some sort of statement or point, which OK I think I understood, but I also don't like things like that being forced because they don't flow naturally with the storytelling and feel more wedged in. I don't know how political the movie is intended to be, but whether I agree with the points or not, I'd at least like a movie to have these ideas flow well and not be ratcheted in.

I would recommend this movie to people who enjoy Korean cinema, topics about class disparity, terror/horror drama, and maybe even just something different to the typical American movie norm. It is well-produced and generally well-directed, the characters and situations are memorable, you'll be shocked, but ultimately if you're anything like me, you'll be disappointed but glad you saw it too.","Jan 16, 2021"
6,I hate to say it but...,"The only reason this movie got the fame and awards it got is because it is a korean movie. And let me be clear here, not just specifically korean but literally any non-US movie on par with Parasite in terms of quality would have been as successful as Parasite anyway; with a bit of luck of course. Actually not just a bit of luck; they would need all the stars in universe to align as well because that's what happened with Parasite. It is nothing but an average movie that only got this boosted because some people decided to take a look outside the rock they have been living under for over decades and they saw this average movie and thought ""That's a lot better than what I expected!"". Domino effect followed and today, we got this movie that's overrated and predictable. No different than your average ""ThRiLLeR"" movie.

P. S.: The only reason I went this hard on the movie is because the internet went so good on it and the movie got more than it deserved anyway so keep calm, the movie is still watchable; when drunk.","Jul 23, 2021"
6,Overhyped. There's so much better social commentary coming out of other countries for obvious resasons.,"Spoiler free review: My family watches 75% Korean shows so I'm very familiar with what's on offer here. Is 'Parasites' head and shoulders above 99.99% of what the country produces? Yes. Does it have a cool twist? Meh, I saw it see more as a sudden a genre change well towards the end of the movie. Is it accessible to western audiences? Absolutely, but we'll never know if we missed anything from the original korean.

But ultimatey it's a very light hearted comedy for 1h52 hours, followed by comedy horror for 5 minutes, and drama for 10.

Expecting a deep social commentary from SK is like expecting a critique of the CCP coming out of China. At no point is the 'system' that created the situation depicted criticised in any meaningful manner. There was far more depth in 'the platform'.

Enjoyed the goofy, light hearted laughs, the heartwarming , well depicted family interactions, and the dramatic bittersweet ending. 6/10","May 9, 2020"

Yes, it's a good film, funny, silly, good acting (not all) etc but ""Best film "" er no ... there are loads of good films equally as good as this but not worthy of the awards it's been given. Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed it but films like 1917 are head and shoulders above this in every way. I know you can't compare the two films in their content but to get best film in my opinion is to tick all the boxes in all categories above the rest, yes??? well Parasite just doesn't do it.","Mar 12, 2020"
6,Overrated,I was hoping for something more.I thought it was going to surprise me but it wasnt.It is fun but lacking of wow factors.,"Feb 11, 2020"
6,Bong Joon-Ho's most uninspired film to date.,"Before I attempt to justify the reasoning for my rating, I must provide a disclaimer professing my appreciation for Bong Joon-Ho's past work. ""Snowpiercer"" was the film that marked him on the map and allowed me to discover his other films, which turned out to be every bit as great as Snowpiercer was. I'm a huge fan of his, and I was extremely thrilled to hear of his unanimous Palme d'Or win. He's a great filmmaker and has the experience to show for it, and I'd say winning that award had been a long time coming for him. However, after my boundless anticipation for this film, and finally getting the chance to actually watch it, I was inevitably itching with a feeling of disappointment.

I've read many reviews of this film, all of them flooded with unworthy praise. Many people have stated that this is one of the best films of the past decade, filled with ""metaphors and allegories which need you to think beyond a certain level as they are manifested throughout."" Others have stated that the film takes numerous twists and turns, and unfolds in ""satisfying, unexpected ways,"" leaving the viewer wondering what's gonna happen next. The former sentiment's mention of ""metaphors and allegories,"" and the way they are presented in this film, have been done countless times over the course of mankind's brief existence, and class conflict has been a recurring theme in anecdotes for centuries even before Marx introduced his theory, yet people still find this elementary concept somehow elusive. There's only one dramatic moment that could be deemed a ""twist"" in the film, which ultimately wasn't that surprising given the endless amount of times this corporeal narrative device has been used since the dawn of storytelling. Besides that moment, everything is utterly predictable. I don't understand how people can act like the film is some unprecedented feat which challenges themes never challenged before. Seemingly every Hollywood blockbuster thriller presents a concept not that dissimilar from the concepts utilized by Bong Joon-Ho for this film.

Additionally, ""Parasite"" suffers from glaring screenwriting issues, the most blatant one being an over-reliance on convenient narrative tools to artificially move the story forward, rather than letting it flow naturally. I'm not going to spoil what exactly happens, but as an example, there's a certain set of stairs in the film that acts as the focal point for the story's progression. Characters make uncharacteristic mistakes that are beyond the realm of believability, which sacrifices the film's sense of authenticity and causes the tension to feel forced. Using gimmicky writer's tricks like this can make or break a film, and if anything, it shows a sign of sheer laziness from everyone involved in the screenwriting process, Bong Joon-Ho obviously included.

Creativity is another criterion that I exceptionally value when judging a film, and ""Parasite"" lacks in that department as well. Simply put, it's a perfectly capable film made by a perfectly capable director. Nothing more, nothing less. On the absolute surface level, it's a supremely entertaining movie, and if you're typically non-analytical and you prefer shutting your brain off before watching a movie, then this might actually be a great popcorn flick for you. But as far as the artistry goes, there's nothing to really be had with this film. Bong Joon-Ho's prowess behind and in-front of the camera was to be expected: The performances, the cinematography, the quirky lines of dialogue, etc. But with the exception of the expected, every aspect of this film is totally unchallenging and risk-averse.

All in all, I'm still content with Bong Joon-Ho's Palme d'Or win, more so for the excellence of his early work than for the film that actually got awarded. Do I think there may have been some politics/hidden agenda involved behind the scenes at Cannes? Possibly, especially considering the flak he got two years ago due to ""Okja"" and its affiliation with Netflix. Regardless, in the grand scheme of his filmography, I'd rate ""Parasite"" towards the bottom rung in his otherwise exemplary résumé. And if you're curious, I'd rate ""Memories of Murder"" and ""Mother"" at the tippy top, which shouldn't come as a surprise.","Oct 3, 2019"

So it remains a bunch of snipets, greatly shot clips, but the story loses itself if not in the worst of all, in oceandeep hopelessness, it is the saddest experience leaving the theatre. 9 for the pictures, 1 for the story. sorry no.","Oct 17, 2019"
6,high expectations,"I was looking forward to Parasite because of the very high rating and the 4 Oscars. Maybe my expectations have been too high for that reason. Anyways, someone has to explain, what on earth is so awesome in it. There is 1 Oscar for the story which is like: a clever poor family deceives a naive rich family.

But I can name hundreds of movies that haven't even been nominated in that category before, with a better story.

The actors do a good job. It is watchable to kill time. Yes. Some scenes are fun. Yes. Some people claim it is one of the best movies of the decade. Really? For sure, it is NOT one of the best of the decade. It's not a bad movie by any means, just overrated.","Feb 24, 2021"

Very intelligent and resourceful Kim family living in the extreme poverty seems the weak point of the script.

6,this aint it chief,"I dont see it. i dont see why this would be the great film everybody's talking about. the story isnt all that grand, the acting is fine, camerawork is sometimes good but mostly kept simple and the ending is also fine.

6,"Entertaining, but I didn't like the message","The one thing I got from this movie is that Bong Joon-ho must really hate rich people. This is even more obvious when you consider that his other notable film is basically about the same thing. Rich vs poor. This is a bit odd considering he has a net worth of 30 million dollars.

This movie is about a poor family that lies and weasels their way into the service of a rich family. In doing so they not only screw over several people but also murder a few of them in the process. And yet at the end of the film we're supposed to feel that all of this is somehow justified.

Or maybe we're not supposed to feel that it's justified because I sure didn't.

Not really sure why it got so much praise. Could be because we are living in a time when the majority of movies being made are superheros or reboots. Thats basically the only thing this movie has going for it. It was entertaining and well made but I didn't like the ending at all.","Dec 15, 2020"
6,Good moive? Yes. Oscar worthy? Nope.,"As I watched the Academy Awards gala and wondered who and what would win in each category I never in my wildest dreams thought of or considered Parasite. But that is just because I hadn´t seen it beforehand and didn´t know if it was that good as they say. But I guess I didn´t consider it to win anything much, because in my opinion there were so many wonderful movies represented this year and especially for the Oscar for best movie. There were so many gems and yes, I had my favourites that I was rooting for. I was extremely disappointed when I found out that Parasite won best picture. And then I felt bad and thought to myself well it is not right for me to judge this movie without even seeing it, maybe it is genius and excellent and so much more than the Joker or Once Upon a Time in Hollywood. So yesterday I finally got around to watching the much praised Oscar-winning Parasite.

The first half of the movie was abysmal for me. Maybe because I just didn´t quite understand how to feel about it, how to relate to it and was trying to think where would the story go. There were some good moments and I liked the camera work, the angles and a few comical incidents. But mostly I couldn´t wait for it to get to the point. I know some people said exactly the same about Once Upon a Time in Hollywood as well, that it was boring during the first half. But in that I don´t agree, I was fully enjoying the director´s vision in that, the actors, the dialogues, everything. But in Parasite I couldn´t really find those things to enjoy. I am not saying the acting was bad, but I also cannot say it was excellent in some way. The second half got interesting for me. I liked the way the story progressed, how things started happening, how people showed their true colors and how human nature is sometimes just awful. And there were a fair amount of suspenseful moments where I actually held my breath a bit and wanted to find out how the scene is going to play out. So, this is all good, this is what a movie is supposed to do - entertain you. The ending - in my opinion it was good (not mind-blowingly excellent) and morbid (also not a bad thing, but makes you think and analyze). So all-in-all it is hard to even give it a score that I am sure of. At first I thought I will give it a 7, because as I said, at least half the time I was interested and invested on the storyline. But I guess I am a bit biased since I am still a bit shocked about the whole Oscar thing and it irritates me a bit. In my opinion a Best Picture movie should be amazing, with a wow-factor, with outstanding directing and acting, storyline - it should have it all, it should be the best of the best that there is. Compared to all the nominees for that award, I just don´t see how Parasite would or should win and why it did, I guess I´ll never know.","Feb 13, 2020"
6,Just another art house film,"Nothing to see here. No idea how it won the best motion picture.

I kept losing focus, it was just not that amazing. I've seen 100s of foreign films, this was far from the best.","Feb 24, 2020"
6,People giving this a 10 need to up their game,"Pretty simply, I was expecting a slow burn thriller with an jaw dropping ending...I mean, this did beat out 1917 for best picture and that movie blew me away!

So i watched with anticipation, waiting for that screw to turn...waiting and waiting until the final act when the resolution hit and I was like...uh, that's it?? I wont say what it is, but it was very underwhelming.

This is not a horrible movie, but its in no way a 10 or worthy of an oscar.","Feb 14, 2020"
6,Oscar !! Really ???,"Somehow never understood what does the panel find while they give there judgment. This movie was ok but seriously why an oscar, did not get that part. I read people giving reviews about the genre this film has, there are lots of movies which has many genres and much better than this movie.","Apr 25, 2020"
6,2nd half ruins the movie,First half does everything right and keeps you intrigued and laughing simultaneously. The second half and finale of this movie leaves you amazed that someone can botch such a work of art simply by not keeping it simple and consistent and opting for an attempt at a deep shocking firework conclusion. Rookie mistake. By giving this a 10 out of 10 you are simply dropping your standards and succumbing to media bias.,"Jun 9, 2020"
6,Over Hyped!,Don't believe the hype. This a a good movie don't get me wrong. It's well made and keeps you interested for most of it. But it completely unravels in the ending where it just seemed rushed to finish it. It reminded me of Game of Thrones where they didn't know how to wrap it up.,"Feb 13, 2020"
6,Maybe Could Have Happened?,"This is not about the first half or weird second half of the movie. Personally, I don't like stories that are so ridiculously unbelievable advertised as plausible. A good premise, that turned into a dumb plot twist that worked for the writer director but not me. In the end it made no sense and if all that happened it might have been news worthy but not cinema.","Jan 18, 2020"
6,"My God People, Really?? Get Your heads out of the sand","After reading all the glowing reviews, especially about how this film is one of the best of the decade I had to see it for myself- the plot it self wasn't anything ground breaking, and while the technical aspect of the film were flawless and i enjoyed it for the first hour, the ending was a total let down (lots of plot holes that I won't get into here) I agree with some other reviewers, the Park family weren't your typical rich snobs, the father worked for his money and came home home and was always there for his children and polite to the domestics, the problem was the family was just too darn naive and foolish, but not terrible people by any means, all in all just a mixed bag, Shoplifters was a much more engaging and heart felt piece of foreign cinema, and I highly recommend watching that!!","Feb 8, 2020"
6,Felt for everyone except the protagonists,"Parasite starts out with a rather familiar gritty arthouse vibe. Some humor is sprinkled in as Ki-woo (Choi Woo-Shik) scans the ceiling and windows for some unprotected (or underprotected) wi-fi to steal as the unemployed family can't afford phone service and they need it to find work. Their partially underground dwelling is susceptible to various indignities from drunken pee and bug killing gasses to flood. When they do get a gig assembling pizza boxes, they can't seem to get it right for some reason. Their luck changes when Ki-woo's friend Min (Seo-joon Park) passes his tutoring job on to him. I little fib and a lot of confidence, and the money starts flowing in to the Kim family. But then he sees an in for his sister Ki-jung (So-dam Park). I suppose simply introducing her as his sister who is legitimately good at art might not have worked, so they go for a much bigger lie and paycheck. Greed is kicking in with head spinning intensity. Before long the family is doing things so atrocious, I started borderline hating the film. Because its protagonists are so unjustifiably vile. To be sure, I loved the parasite allegory. One gets in, starts multiplying, eventually severely damaging or destroying the host. That last part I was dreading the most. Yes, I was also dreading what will happen once the scam is discovered. But I felt really bad for the mother (Yeo-jeong Cho) who inadvertently brought the infestation into her home. She was just trying to do what any mother would - what's best for her kids. Her only fault - she wasn't too bright. Of course, I could have never anticipated the crazy plot twist that unraveled it all. But as the story rolled towards the end in a gut wrenching tangle of victims and perpetrators, the ""host"" family was treated as if their suffering were at best unimportant, at worst - funny. And they are the ones who did nothing wrong. Except for being rich - I suppose that automatically makes them villains. It was really bothering me. But that wasn't the only problem I had with the film. It didn't make sense to me how the Kims could come up with and perfectly execute an elaborate scheme, when they couldn't even assemble pizza boxes right. And if they are this smart, how is it possible that even the two young ones can't get work? Is Korean economy that bad? Another problem was that interesting things were introduced, but dropped without explanation. Like we never found out why the old housekeeper looked like she had been mugged. Or what Ki-woo was planning to do with the lucky stone. And that wonderful allegory that existed so naturally in the first half of the movie? Not completely gone in the second, but you have to look for it.","Feb 3, 2020"
6,"It's different, and odd, which I usually like",But I really don't love it as much as all the fuss. It did not deserve to sweep the Oscars. Didn't love it,"Jun 20, 2020"
6,With all due respekt,"As for the rich , basic thing dey do is instal CCTVs in their households , found it overrated as it has too many cinematic liberties taken. Tuition teacher or houskeeping of an internation category cant be done overnight even without a proper interview frm the rich. With all respekt for its oscars , Parasite is a good one time watch & not on par with The old boy","Feb 17, 2020"
6,Overlong,"I found this film overlong. The film starts off well and the first half is light as the poorer family invagle themselves into the richer family. However, at this point the film takes a tonal shift and whilst this is understandable it jars with what has gone before. The film takes an age to end which I found irritating.","Feb 8, 2020"
6,"Entertaining, Overrated and Politically Correct!","This is a well-made film but is far from achieving masterpiece status, and those who are capriciously throwing that word around must be cinematically starved. To give a movie an Academy Award for best picture and best director without nominating any of its actors is indicative of the fact that while the film's screenplay is definitely intriguing, character development is sorely lacking, along with any kind of memorable performances. Did the director direct a gang of ghosts? The message of the film is politically correct, and although I agree with it, I see this as just another ""Green Book"" cop out. I'm also appalled that the movie glorifies violence as a solution to economic disparity, a disparity that is directly attributable to governments and not as individualistically motivated as this movie so strongly suggests. Good film? Yes!! Masterpiece and Best Picture of The Year? Absolutely Not!! And we might as well just do away with the foreign film category now that this boundary no longer seems to mean anything.","Feb 12, 2020"
6,Don't believe the hype.,"I appreciate the effort of the Parasite team, the director Joon-Ho Bong in particular. He tried hard to get recognized from the international audience by creating a non-typical Korea film. Unfortunately, this is overdoing. The movie is too long and quite boring. Many scenes are unnecessary. Yes, there are times that the movie are fun and entertaining, but to say it is the best film of the year, I don't think it is the case at all. I will be shocked if this movie wins any Oscar award.","Jan 28, 2020"
6,A very solid but lacking film which I'm sorry to see becoming a representative of the Korean film industry,"Solid-to-good movie (would almost give a 7) that I definitely enjoyed. It's got Bong's style and especially his tone written all over it, which is characteristically simultaneously all over the place (in this case, goofy, tense, thrilling, emotional, tragic, violent, and even reminiscent of Oceans 11) and seamlessly interwoven without feeling sudden moving one from one feeling to the other, which is something I don't know any other director to pull of so well. But that's something you can say about most of the guy's films.

It's a ""fun"" move but that's where it stops more or less. Yeah, there's OMG THEMES and CLASS, but throwing those in doesn't change the movie.

I'd go through the things that lessen the film for me, but I've typed enough as is, and the issues are pretty apparent on your second/third viewing.

Don't know, it's a fine movie, but there were GREAT ones that people don't bat an eye over.

I just dread hearing people talking about this and saying ""OMG DID U EVER TRY WATCHING KOREAN MOVIES BEFORE???"" It's sure happened to me. I hope it dies down.

All in all, it's a decent, well-placed movie with masterful use of tone, but Cannes and the Oscars and all the people on this very site raving could do so much better. I just hope the movie will be a gateway for people rather than being that movie that lets you say ""Hey, I've seen FOREIGN films before!""","Feb 18, 2020"
6,Interesting but certainly not spectacular!,"The movie covers a variety of genres and social issues that rapidly developing countries like South Korea are facing, a sudden but unequal distribution of wealth, and inequality between classes. It revolves around a family of Grifters who feel they must take back power and exact revenge on a wealthy class family. The problem with the film is that it tends to drag out and become boring after a while. The viewer loses interest. The story could have been told in a much shorter time. It does tend to show what lengths people will go to if they feel they are the underdog, and what they are capable of doing to extract revenge.","Mar 1, 2020"
6,Over rated,I think this film is overrated. Not sure about all the coincidences happened to the family members are making sense.,"Oct 15, 2019"
6,Good story but too hyped,"The story was good. Acting is great. It basically shows the reality of rich and poor difference that exists in our society no matter what. My only reason to give it 6 star is with all the hype this movie has, My expectations were way too high and sadly it didn't live upto that.","Mar 19, 2020"
6,"Solid acting, atmosphere, music but the plot runs short.","I don't mind symbolism. I think it adds extra depth to a story, granted you're looking for it. But if a story cannot exist strongly without symbolism...it's not really a story worth telling. This was one of them. The locations ran old after a very short amount of time and the ending was SO long and drawn out. And to come to what conclusion? Pretty flimsy.","Mar 13, 2020"
6,"Started off great, then tanked - and I get the message","This film is either a love or hate review. I get that most that hate it maybe didn't understand the message - I did, but it was written in a mind-boggling illogical plot-hole ridden way. What makes it even worse, is how great it was from the start, that when the ridiculousness kicked in, you become extremely disappointed. There are so many ways this could've been written much better - and still get the message across, and maintain the initial theme without tanking. Directing and cinematography were excellent, and the casting on point. And the 132 min runtime was flying by, until the plot started to tank. Clearly over-hyped and not worth anything more than my 6/10","Jan 27, 2020"
6,This movie came put of nowhere,"Being an american it is difficult to know when foregin films are released and how to watch them but this film was a surprise. The picture quality was probably one of the best ive ever seen and really complimented my television. The acting was excellent for such a varied age cast and the story was unique, it kept me guessing and definetley cements South Korea as a movie up an comer in my mind.","Aug 20, 2020"
6,9? rly?,"Yes its a good movie but not nearly as good as Snowpiercer. That has lower rating for some unknown reason. Script is predictable and does not display any direct critique on the class conflict. so it could be easely missenterprited! The poor actually look unworthy in this supposed masterpiece. if thats not major flaw i dont know what is. acting is extrimply poor. camera -not bad but nothing special. overall ark is childish , no suspense or dramatic high points.","Feb 20, 2020"

6,Only average,Average movie and I still don't get it how this movie won the academy award for the best motion picture of the year. It felt like it would never end.,"Feb 23, 2020"
6,simple opinion without any spoilers,"1.This movie is too over rated, I don't know, maybe it is something wrong with me because so many people appreciates this film superlatively...

2. All the characters are pathetically unlikable. They only show flaws. You don't want to be them; you don't want to be with them ... not at the beginning, nor in the middle, nor in the end.

3. This lowlife 4-member family was at bay and struggled to a barely survived condition, the husband/father was unemployed for a very long time, the wife was nothing but a mean heartless woman, the son and the daughter had failed the college entry exams for so many times. This helpless and hopeless family couldn't simply become a well practiced con-artist family overnight. If they were such great scammers, they would not have fallen so low and so helpless for such a long time. They don't have money to afford a dignified basic living standard. They would not be possible to suddenly become expert con-artist so easy and so soon.

4. I don't understand what the intention of the director is? What does he want to explain or to prove? Is it a critic of social inequalities? Is it a thriller? A comedy? I don't know and none of these styles is addressed adequately.","Apr 10, 2020"
6,Oscars are overrated,"This movie is about good direction, good acting but it's a movie riddled with plot holes.","Mar 28, 2020"
6,High expectations on this one...,"Well executed on many levels. But when a non english speaking film wins an Oscar for best picture, needles to say the expectations are really high, and for my money they did not reach all the way. Half way thru I felt it was promising, but the last half hour lowered the rating for me. Over all a good movie but no way nere fantastic.","Mar 1, 2020"
6,Personal charlatans,"So maybe I'm an uncultured swine or maybe some of the effect was lost in translation... but whatever it may be, I'm not sure I understand the hype around this movie.

Don't get me wrong, it was good... but it wasn't all that. To be honest I thought it was just above average. I think I may have liked it more if it was a bit more concise. The almost two hour long run time made it feel drawn out especially for nothing super intriguing taking place. There were definitely solid moments throughout, good acting and a general level of engagement, it just didn't super draw me in.

I think if I had watched this without being privy to any of the hype I might have liked it more, but I guess I was just slightly disappointed. Regardless, this is for sure a fun and thrilling movie that I would still recommend.","Jan 19, 2024"
6,Overrated,"Well, I can't understand how this film defeated The Joker and 1917 at the Oscars.

Nice movie, yes, but not spectacular.

A lot of plot shortcuts, as if the poor family were world class con artists. So illogical.","Feb 14, 2020"
6,Not what i expected from an Oscar winner.,"First half of the movie was really boring. Second half was kinda interesting though. An the ending was really really bad for my opinion. The other thing that was annoying is that the actors over played at times and the worse of all was the actor who played the boss lady . She was over playing and it was really annoying. I don't know if those were the directions but I did not like it at all. In conclusion not an Oscar worth movie, not a masterpiece...","Feb 13, 2020"
6,an alright watch,"It's a ""lyrical comedy"" film (which means it's not funny, but you are not supposed to cry over the misfortunes either) with a dramatic story. To put it simply it's a ""slice of scam"" movie.

It's a bit weird in looking ""more"" than its subject matter, but it's not pretentious. All the film-students-never-film-workers and the so-called ""movie"" ""critics"" tried their hardest to make you think this is some indie art-house mumblecore drama about gay-cowboys eating pudding, and oscars are always a ""black spot"" for the movies, but in the end this is an alright watch. And it will leave you with nothing, just like all the average films.","Nov 21, 2023"
6,"Good, but very overrated","Pretty good film but not even close to living up to the hype of the praise it gets. My guess is that the Hollywood Elite have embraced this movie as a way to virtue signal that they get the suffering and unfairness of it all!

Acting is good, movie is too long for sure, all unlikeable characters mostly","Feb 24, 2020"
6,WAY OVER RATED,"This is way way over rated, its a 6 at best. Yes some bits are funny. But others it just drags on. The actings okay. Plots okay. Its just really an okay film overall. Nothing special.","Apr 13, 2022"
6,I don't get it,"What a weird movie! Parasite has some interesting things going on, it's a psychological thriller with elements of Stephen King's Misery, but then it also has self reflecting internal monologues that remind me of Trainspotting.","Feb 29, 2020"
6,More horror than comedy,"The film is wellmade in many aspects and maybe it deserves its Oscars this year. Certainly it is about time to award the Oscar for a film performed in another language than english. But it is not close to a masterpiece. It does not measure up to films like A Separation, Life is beautiful, The Postman, Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon and many others films that deserved an Oscar for best picture.

There are many other things this film is not. It is more a tragic horror movie and a deliberative reflection on class society than a comedy. There are no laughing moments in this film unless you have an extremely dark sense of humor. The acting is very uneven, sometimes brilliant and sometimes amateurish, and the script, even though it is certainly original and in many aspects wellwritten, has several obvious plotholes.","Feb 10, 2020"
6,Its ok,"This movie for me is a solid 6. It's obstacles are from critics reviews putting it at a 10. Its not that good and cant live up to those expectations. If you watch it , you wont have wasted your time. If you don't watch it, you won't have missed much. Its average.","Sep 1, 2020"
6,"Poor pacing, too few twists, too unbelievable","I think there's a really good movie buried in ""Parasite"" somewhere, but I gave up trying to find it. It has the same problem the director's previous ""The Host"" had: the pacing is broken.

That's not all, though. People have written about the movie's unexpected twists and turns. The thing is, it keeps you waiting far too long for these to arrive, they are too few and far between, and too unbelievable. The first major twist happens about an hour in, and seems to come out of nowhere.

The parts of the movie detailing how this horrible family coordinates an incredible con on the rich Parks are the best bits, though they are far fetched: how can people with the ingenuity to do that be such losers beforehand?

But then that first twist hit and the movie lost me increasingly, until by the end I wasn't even paying attention.

Pity. Some of the sequences were brilliant.","Dec 20, 2019"
6,NOT AN OSCAR MOVIE,"Comparing the nominees, this movie is surely not an Oscar wining movie. Ahhhh but Hollywood has something else in their mind. Anyways, a good watch though, unique story about the class difference.","Jan 10, 2021"
6,Shallow,"This movie just shows how pretentious and shallow people are. Unless, that's the directors objective showing the people who call this movie a masterpiece as shallow people. If that's his intention, it's a great movie.

I bet you most people can't objectively agree on why they like this movie. Perhaps, it is truly a masterpiece for the sophisticated movie goers and other people who understand the themes of the movie well but these are like 20% of those calling it a masterpiece..

For the ordinary person, it is just very average movie that if you saw without knowing it was PARASITE *cue the applause the trails*.

I did not feel anything for the poor people. Blame capitalism all you want but, they didn't have to go that far. You argue it's greed but they are supposedly smart or street smart but through out the movie. They make very foolish decisions which ultimately ends in this end which is a tragedy for the rich. I mean, if it's a poor people vs rich, then obviously their family would have the other poor family. You add greed?

All in all. I'm tired now. Enjoy being pretentious","Jun 7, 2020"
6,Goes Downhill Faster Than A Bobsleigh!,"I sat down with great expectations. I ended up disappointed. The first hour is absolutely cracking and whilst the plot is very predictable it plays out beautifully with some good comedic lines.

The movie then dries up a little and it feels like it's lost its mojo before it then goes BANG!

Bang good or bang bad will be up to the individual as to how much escapism you can tolerate and how many holes you are willing to gloss over.

For me it was bang bad however I have also watched the Irishman recently so compared to that crock this is like a masterpiece!

Was it worth a watch? Yes. Would I pay at the cinema again? Definitely not! The moral of the story is that in Hollywood we cannot trust!","Feb 14, 2020"
6,Average at best,"It is understood that Hollywood wanted to attract more costumers in Asia by handing this movie Oscars' Best Picture and Best Directing. I can't see how this movie surpasses ""Once Upon a Time in Hollywood"" or ""Irishman"" in terms of the acting. This movie is average at best. The suspense is average (not better than ""Knives Out""). The thrill is cheap. The cinematography is average. Too much implausibility. ""Marriage Story"" is even more entertaining that this movie.","Feb 12, 2020"
6,Not a 10/10,"Interesting, yet flawed movie. First of all the movie has 0 replay value, which I keep in high regard. Second, no explanation about the obvious masterful bamboozling ability of the Kim family is given other than ms Park is ""gullible"". The movie also has some significant problems regarding its emotional nexus. Everything feels distant and random at best. In addition, even though I liked similar rapid genre swap in Miikes ""Audition"", the trick does not work here that well. Still, a watchable, yet disposable movie.","May 14, 2020"
6,Probably the first proper review..,"Let's start with that I've seen a lot. It's all public. In the most cases meta's score given to a movie shows a better rating, a more realistic one compared to imdb.

I've seen 1917, I was sick of that people don't even know what cinematography is. The whole movie was made like ""Rope"" except that Rope had an amazingly interesting story. 1917 had nothing in it. Paths of Glory was in many terms a lot more realistic. Long story short, I didn't like 1917 at all. I had no idea why it was even nominated.

Then I saw the Marriage Story. As soon as I realised Adam Driver is in it (Star Wars guy), I just wanted to not like the movie because I don't like the new SW movies at all. Then it turned out it was amazing. He was very good, the movie was very good. I liked The Irishman too but the Marriage Story was superior.

Then came the awards and Parasite won. I saw it has a score of 8.6 and I know the director. He did a crime movie which I liked (Memories of a Murder). That one was very good.

So I just watched Parasite too.

It was interesting, but maybe I've seen too many actually good movies, so I do not blow my mind just like that.

The characters were ok and maybe that's all. The story was just interesting. There was nothing special about it. It was an original story, but it won't make it good. It has nothing to tell us. It's pretty much like a half written mess. If somebody works for me for years, I won't fire him/her just because a tale someone told me. I would atleast question the worker. Atleast! At this point the movie was very unrealistic.

The smell factor. We can't smell it :) But all that food as whiskey on that table has a strong smell. You can clearly see under the table. I just had no idea how is that realistic.. They were all given good wages and still they didn't take a shower or anything like that. They did all smell bad.. Sooo unrealistic and because of it the father's motivation made absolute no sense. No sense at all. Especially in that situation.

It felt like they had to end the story somehow and they chose this way for some reason.

Other factors of the movie are no special neither.

Roma stands on 7.7 and is by far better in every aspect.

Currently I've rated over 2500 movies, I write scripts, I'm working on to direct one of my works myself and I have to tell you that this movie was just OK and I have really no idea why would anyone give it a score of 8 or higher. If I would write and direct a movie like this, I would be not satisfied. Not at all. For me it was 6.5 as it was interesting. Also it's genre is drama/thriller. There was not a single second in the movie that was comedic!","Mar 30, 2020"
6,!! Overrated !!,"I didn't find the movie so interesting. It felt like Mr. Bong was so confused about how to end the movie. The story ran so fast and the household shown was extra ordinary naive, which is also abnormal as a such big businessman.

I couldn't break the 2 inch boundary of subtitle too. But this movie could be better.","Mar 7, 2020"
6,Avarage Movie,"I do not think this is a grate movie. The owner of the house totally believes the driver, and others too. at the final stage why the driver is stabling the owner? because he doesn't t like the smell of the t- shirt of the driver? stupid story. but end looks realistic.","Mar 19, 2020"
6,"Good movie, but best motion picture of the year?","It's not a bad movie, it's a good perspective on society and what money creates. But I couldn't agree less with Oscar for best motion picture, come on, so good movies in 2019! WTF Hollywood?","Feb 15, 2020"
6,"Fine, but Overrated.","This film doesn't allow easy reviewing because it has many aspects, many ways to look at. Is it thriller? Comedy? Drama? Societal critique? It's all of it; and therefore none of it. All in all, I was underwhelmed and mildly frustrated.

The style is there, I grant it. Cinematography is great. Acting is awkward at some points, but it's OK because of the partially comedy-like nature of this film.

But then, there is a problem with story telling. It builds up nicely toward the middle, where the parasites settle in their host and discover the secret down below. And then it makes an unexpected turn. It's alright to make a surprise at the end (I'd even say it's good), as long as it flows reasonably from the preceding story line. A reveal must make sense once it is revealed. This one didn't do the job convincingly for me. We are given very little clue about why people acted the way they did at the birthday party.

This film is just fine, but no masterpiece in my opinion. Some films are so easy to understand to the point of being insulting; others are so obscure to the point of being pointless. Great films do it just right somewhere in this spectrum. Unfortunately, this one is leaning to the pointlessness.","Mar 4, 2020"
6,way too overrated,"Probably the movie collapsed under the expectations I had because of all the hype (and specially awards). First the good bits, the rare mix of various genres into one movie is something that might keep you on the edge of your seat or overburden your cognitive ability. All the actors have delivered a good performance and cinematography is good too. Some scenes depicting abject urban poverty are really riveting. But if the writer or director wanted to deliver a message about poverty, they have further muddied the waters by expressing this as poverty. A few healthy adults, who had no unforeseen shocks to their ability to work hard and earn a decent living, go on to do things which range from boundaryline unethical to pure heinous crimes. A long drawn second half makes it boring. One of the reviews I watched about this film says ""A good movie is the one where you can't tell who is the villain"". Well you will be able to tell all the villains by the time the movie ends, and you guessed it right, its definitely not ""poverty"".

This movie definitely did not deserve the Oscars over 1917 and Joker. period.","Jun 29, 2020"
6,I don't have same idea with others,"Actually until I watched the movie, I heard lots of good critics. It's wonderful, very impressive etc. But I don't agree, the first half of movie was good and also funny, but I can't say the same thing to other half, it wasnt realistic. And I reckon not as good as people standarts","Dec 6, 2019"
6,Entertaining? YES. Oscar worthy? NO,"I enjoyed this movie with all the twists and turns and surprises. It's worth watching and there is not a dull moment in it. I think this is GOOD film making, but not the best movie of the year.

I've heard others call this a movie about class structure. Yes, but in true Hollywood fashion, the rich people are generous and trusting if a little naive. The poor people are conniving criminals willing to take what is not theirs, or cheat and lie if given the opportunity.

Watch to be entertained. That's it. Don't read anything into it.","Feb 16, 2020"
6,Didn't live up to the hype,"Finally got around to watching this movie, even though being a long time Korean movie fan.

Unsure how this won an Oscar and has such a high rating. Thought the same with Spirited Away, appears that these movies won Oscars for being different to the Hollywood norm, I think so anyway.

It was a fun watch, but not the best of movies like others would suggest. If you have seen many Korean movies before, you will understand that they don't follow the typical Hollywood formula. Watching this is nothing new and there are far better examples of amazing Korean movies.

Overall, this is worth a watch for sure, but it isn't the best of any genre IMHO.","Jul 20, 2022"
6,Worth the watch,"This movie is... memorable. I went into it not knowing what to expect at all, which is how I'd recommend others watch it as well. I would rate the movie an 8, but I find it hard to justify why. If I imagine the exact same story being played out in an American setting, it would get a 4 from me at most. So I settled on a 6... The storyline is absolutely rediculous, but you can't help but to keep watching. Interestingly, the movie doesn't convince you to root for the main characters. That might be it's biggest strength. This movie is definitely worth the watch, if only so that you can form your own opinion.","Jul 7, 2020"
6,Overrated,"Parasite reminds me of those novels you sometimes read in English class or a literature club (ala Ulysses) and you had to appreciate all the intricacies, themes, and symbolism or risk looking uncultured. But those novels missed something really important, that gets lost in all the circlejerking about the symbolism and little details - whether or not its actually interesting to read. Whether it provides a good story, good dialogue, good characters.

Similarly, Parasite is a movie rich in themes and symbolism. What I particularly liked is the mature exploration of class dynamics. Its the obvious central theme of the film and its done very well. I dont think anything in Hollywood could ever manage to explore this theme with such nuance and maturity.

This movie is also a really good work of art. The direction is top quality, and it effortlessly goes from comedy, to family drama, to horror, to thriller, and then finally ends in a Tarantino-esque finale.

But the actual plot of the film? The dialogues, the drama, its all mediocre at best. What really happens in this film. What makes a viewer curious, interested, surprised? How do the characters develop, how does the plot develop, where and when is there interesting dialogue that pulls you in?

In my opinion, the overarching script of this movie is not particularly strong when you evaluate it in terms of core storytelling. And worse, it doesn't use its runtime well in order to tell whatever it wants to tell. And while a film critic might be impressed by its symbolism and the way it shifts in tone and genres, I think it actually detracts from the viewer experience if the primary aim of the viewer is to see an enjoyable movie.

I'm far from someone who merely enjoys popcorn fiction. There's a reason I hate Marvel movies. But I also think that a movie has to strike a balance, I don't think Parasite did that. I think it has benefited from collective overhyping that is partially a result of the heaps of praise by critics and partially because it is a decent movie released in a time of popcorn movie trash.","Feb 12, 2022"
6,Decent Movie but Overrated,"I watched this movie based on it's IMDb rating. After all, it scored only 1/10th of a point lower than ""Lord of the Rings"" (first one) so it must be a pretty damn AWESOME movie, right? Well....NO! It wasnt a BAD movie, it just wasnt....magical.

Now, I do love my Sci Fi and Fantasy movies, however movies based on real life can be magical as well. Think ""Silence of the Lambs"" or ""Se7en"". This movie has a decent concept based on the interactions of 2 classes of people. I would go so far as to say there is no clear ""good guy"" and no clear ""bad guy."" In life, there seldom is. That said, it was interesting and entertaining but no way it ranks a 8.6. I think results are being skewed by a foreign market that has (understandable) pride in making a film with international appeal.","Jan 19, 2020"
6,A good film for Certain Audience; Not ME,"Parasite is without a doubt a well-thought good movie. It's clearly that it took lots of brains and talent to produce such a tape. It even has a message and on realities of society and a study on social classes in Korea. It addresses the issue of attitudes and the way we look at life, be it positive or negative, it has a huge impact. In addition, in general i love Asian Cinema, especially Chinese and Korean films. BUT saddly, this not for me.

I did not like it. Did not enjoy it. Once I hit the 90 minute mark i was just about to give up. Still i stayed till the end because of the amazingly great reviews.

Korean movies are just fantastic, and this might not be the exception. I have seen many online and in cinemas. they are AWESOME.

Parasite to me was annoying, depressing, negative.... a total tale of betrayal... Parasite tries to teach that you must never open the doors of your house nor your trust to others... or at least be super careful..?? could be.

You can watch the movie and make up your mind. You might be among the 99.99% of people who loves it. I am in the 0.01 % who do not :)

(my humble opinion)","Feb 7, 2020"
6,Gave it a 7 but because of wokeness I dropped it to 6,The wokeness I am referring to is Hollywood. Best picture? Because it's a foreign film written by non white males and no white males are in the movie. This is a nice way to cap off the decade of insane wokeness. That is the only conclusion I can come to as to why this won so many Oscars (which have been a joke ever since Shakespeare in Love beat Saving Private Ryan for best picture).,"Feb 2, 2021"
6,Let's be honest here,"This movie got the stellar reviews just because the PC crowd got pi**ed off that Joker took all the limelight. There had to be a ""counter-balace"" and this movie got hyped. The first half is overly melodramatic and ""funny"" as in American Pie type funny, and the latter half at the very best portrays some of the struggles of Korean society-presented in a weird and almost Twilight Zone-ish way. But that's litetally it! Besides the sudden plot/atmospheric twist there is little else. Imagine if K-pop was a movie, and the last part of the tune turns to a Metallica song. That's this movie in a nutshell. It was not bad, but all the stellar reviews are give it way too much credit. Joker won, the rest is just attempts to br de jour.","Feb 24, 2020"
6,"Good, but not wonderful.","I had to leave a comment because I have no idea how this movie received an 8.5 rating. 6 range at best. As far as Korean masterpieces go I thought ""The Handmaiden"" and ""The Housemaid"" were far better stories about class. The script had tremendous ideas and I was looking forward to them ... and then they just dropped off and switched to a new plot. It felt very messy. There were scenes that had no follow up or no point. Like they had to fill a plot hole last minute. If hours of this film were cut, that would make sense. It felt like it couldn't decide if it wanted to be a dark drama, or a dark comedy. If it wanted to be just a family friendly dark comedy, you went too far, if you wanted to be a intense drama, you really dropped the ball. It felt like the director wanted to appeal to a wider audience by playing it safe. The more I think about it, the less respect I seem to have for its ""artistic"" merrit. Absolutely Overrated.

As I'm reading throught the miles of reviews, I'm convinced these are westerners who just started watching foreign films this year, or they're all paid. The common theme is people seem to think they are incredibly intelligent for having watched this. Another reviewer commented this is the SAME exact plot as ""Married with Children"" even down to Chicago, Illinois being a factor. Just blew my mind and now I have even less respect for the script.","May 12, 2023"
6,Totally overrated,"There is nothing new about the Movie, just a waste of time, watched it because of the ratings and recommendations, turns out its just bummer 😕..... 2 hours of a boring story and build up for somehow a predicted Ending.","Mar 27, 2022"
6,Learn to think for yourself.,"There are lots of great movies out there. This is just not one of them. Why? Because it's predictable to a degree that I have seldom experienced. All major events can be predicted way ahead of them happening, which makes watching this movie into nothing but a waiting game. It's not deep and it's definitely not clever.

If the director should ever reveal that he made this movie as an experiment to explore how hollow of a movie you can get away with and still have the world hyped, I wouldn't be the least bit surprised.","Jan 8, 2020"
6,PARA-CRAZY,"This is a fun, different movie. But, to be totally honest, as a lover of Asian cinema, not that different. For example Thirst by Park Chan-Wook is off the charts different. But, an ok, if somewhat erratic, sloppy dark comedy nonetheless.

Full of unexpected twists and turns. Some plot points go nowhere unfortunately. Quite a bit of focus at one point in the movie is on the fact that the previous housekeeper's face has been beaten. In fact, the question is specifically raised as to what happened and yet.... never answered. WTF?

A quirky look at the class divide. I found the wrap up at the end a little long and unnecessary, and honestly found some of the final scenes discordant. Switching to a narrated jumpy set of scenes with a dream scene thrown in for good measure. It all seened very amateurish. Which is sad because the first 3 quarters were great.

The individual buttons for the individual stair pendant lights? Really? A ridiculous prop to build in the morse code prop which, in itself, was trivial and silly. Also the master architect designed his escape bunker to resemble a horror set with no egress to the outside world? Very very incongruous and illogical.

Oscar worthy? I definitely don't agree, but there you go.

An amusing non Hollywood movie but so so when compared to its Asian peers. A great opportunity for the less educated Hollywood elite to show how politically woke they are. 🙄","Feb 25, 2020"

6,Ok but overrated,"I love when people get carried away and jump on the bandwagon. Enjoyable? It was ok. Best film of the year? Not a chance. Just because it has subtitles I think some people think they are getting their cultural diversity fix. Its been done better a hundred times over. The comedic element, watch Kung Fu hustle. The serious undertone, watch pretty much anything else. Won't be recommending, wasn't awful, just a bit meh.","Mar 13, 2020"
6,The Prince and the Pauper ........ I've seen this scenario play out a few times before,"Mrs. Shullivan and I finally decided to sit down and read (English sub-titles) this 2020 Academy Award Best Picture winner and both of us felt it was decent enough, but to win ""Best Picture"" against a great film like ""Once Upon a Time In Hollywood"" I think director Quentin Tarantino was absolutely robbed. I guess when the USA is losing a lot of its film credibility with powerhouse producers such as Harvey Weinstein finally being put behind bars and the decades old USA social justice upheavel the Academy felt it was about time to suck up to foreign countries and give the Best Picture to another country to start showing they can be inclusive, so why not send some awards to South Korea?

We heard a lot of good feedback from friends and family about Parasite, and I would agree that the first half was decent enough, but the latter half I felt I was watching a cheap version of a Bruce Lee action film.

I really enjoyed the cinematography, and the set designs were eloquent, but the story failed to impress me and the character development literally fizzled, sort of like when in the 1939 Wizard Of Oz, the wicked witch of the west melted when water was thrown upon her. I cannot honestly say this was a memorable film, certainly not Academy Award Best Picture worthy, and I would not recommend this film as a ""must see"" such as the 2019 One Upon a Time In Hollywood is a must see at least three times.

I give Parasite a decent but no higher IMDB rating then 6 out of 10.","Nov 16, 2020"
6,Mmmmm,"Not my cup of tea. Farce combined with excessive violence, and lots of plot holes as well as character inconsistencies, but what do I know?","Feb 10, 2020"
6,"Technically great, but not a good thriller.",Looks beautifully shot. But the story is slow and just doesn't progress to anything significant or surprising.,"Nov 19, 2019"
6,Overrated just like most other movies on this website,"This is not the first movie ever to try and combine 5-6 different genres and be jack of all trades. Each one I've seen so far failed, and this one is no exception... The story is rather simple and movie is simply too long for such simple story. If they made it like, let's say a 90 minutes long gory comedy it would be just fine. probably worth seeing but definitely not a masterpiece or the best movie of 2019","Jan 22, 2020"
6,Engaging but didn't match the hype,"I won't go into the details of the plot which can be read elsewhere but simply give me impressions. Well directed, interesting story (even if there were some clunky moments), good acting, good dialogue but way too long.

People are raving about PARASITE. I'm not one of them. Masterpiece? Hardly. All the characters are supremely unlikable. Perhaps that was intentional. Ironically, the rich family provoked more sympathy which I doubt WAS intentional. I racked my brain wondering why people are so enthralled by this movie. Do you suppose bc it has a sub text? I mean, of course it has a sub text. it is a satire on the relationship btn the rich and poor in Korea. But that is plainly obvious. It's not subtle. Actually it's not even a sub text, it IS the text. But up against Hollywood cinema which rarely has ANY sub text and usually just presents us with a story on the screen writ large PARASITE then is seen as sophisticated.

I didn't rate PARASITE very highly. That's my loss I guess.","Feb 18, 2020"
6,Overrated :(,I don't want to be a troll but this movie is a bit overrated i think. We have much better dramas in Turkish cinema.,"Mar 7, 2020"
6,If You Love Quentin Tarantino...,"There are countless reviews posted here that delve into this movie's themes. I've read at least 20 of them, and many are engaging and brilliant. But I'm going to do something different. I'll speak to the Tarantinoesque nature of this film.

There's a program on AXS-TV called ""The Big Interview."" Dan Rather spends an hour talking with noted personalities across all genres of pop culture. Several years ago he sat down with Quentin Tarantino (QT) and conducted a wonderful interview. I don't want to include spoilers here so I think that if you're a QT fan you will understand what Dan is referencing, below.

Late into the interview, without accusing him of being exploitive, Dan asks QT to discuss this: How does he have the audience laugh and cry all in the same film? How does he get an audience to view scenes of a horrific nature yet laugh during the movie or come out of the theater smiling?

QT's response: ""when a movie really, really does it to me, it's because it's made me feel very different emotions...I'm the kind of director that I want to play you, as an audience. I want to be the conductor and you're my orchestra. And (I conduct) the sounds that I make you to make, and the feelings that I get you to feel... And then I STOP you from feeling those feelings, and I give you something ELSE to feel. And then I STOP you from feeling those feelings and make you feel something ELSE yet again. Well, if a director can do that, if a director can pull that off...then you're a lucky audience member because you really had an experience that night. You went to the MOVIES; that was worth leaving the house.

I can't help but make my stuff funny because I think of things in a humorous way...but it's not all a big joke. I do like the idea that I can do this to the audience: Laugh. Laugh. Laugh. Stop laughing. Stop laughing. (snaps fingers) Laugh. And maybe that stop laughing is something horrific...(maybe it's) hard to watch."" He then cites specific examples from one of his movies where he said he needed to traumatize the audience.

I love a lot of what QT has done, but not all of it. This movie seems to follow the QT blueprint but then it veers off in one direction and stays there. I did not leave the theater smiling. Thus, my rating.","Jan 22, 2020"
6,Masterpiece!? Please! It was interesting though...,"I'll try and keep this shortish. For reference I think there are at least 3 films of 2019 that were better than parasite including 'Once Upon a Time in Hollywood', 'The Irishman', and 'The Joker'.

If you're not the kind to often seek out great original content than I can imagine why you might think this movie is really some kind of unique, fresh gem. But there are too many plot conveniences and unrealistic character behaviors to really class this as ""The greatest film of the decade"". Not by a mile.

Having said that I found the movie had several interesting threads and themes going on, some of which resolved, and some which were probably the most interesting went nowhere. ie the young 'rich' kids role, among other things. That was slightly disappointing.

I think the so called 'class divide' commentary was there, but not to the extent that everyone raves. It showed more that there is not such a simple black and white difference between the two, which I appreciate. But I think the 'class divide' actually provided more a part of the organic scenery than a driving force of the film.

Overall, I'm glad I saw it, but I would have rather just watched it at home, than paid to see it in gold class. Does that make me a bad person!?","Feb 24, 2020"
6,"Calm down, people.","I do not understand the insane hype surrounding this movie. It was good. Just good. I'm a big Bong Joon Ho fan. And I get what he was going for here. Social commentary/satire with finesse. But he missed the mark with this one. This was no masterpiece, as almost everyone is calling it. Joon Ho did make a masterpiece. It just wasn't ""Parasite"". It was ""Okja"". Brilliant social commentary with a masterful ability to finesse. As far as ""Parasite"", like I said, it was just good. What keeps it from being great, in my opinion, is the fact that there were no likable characters. I didn't care at all about any of them. Big miss. There were many glaring plot holes, but I could have overlooked those if he had given me just one character to root for.It's like eating at a high end restaurant where nothing on the menu looks appealing to you. Disappointment. All of these 10 star reviews are just hive-mind on display.","Mar 16, 2020"
6,Over rated,It's a good movie but really it's over rated. It is also little boring and slow,"Feb 8, 2020"
6,Way overrated,"I came to watch the movie with great expectations. What can i expect from an oscar winner right? Well oh boy was I wrong. Parasite doesn't really shine on any of the areas that make a movie great. Plot, relatable actors, authenticity, dialogue, directing are just mediocre. One thing that was on par with perfect though was the screenplay. Each scene had a exact idea of what to cover and how to do it. It went superb with the plot that by all standards was very very slow and predictable.

If you're looking for something unforgettable, don't pick this movie. It surely is one to be forgotten and one that doesn't excite, bring joy or happiness.

One word review: meh.","Jan 20, 2022"
6,our pipe dreams are content to leave us with nothing more than the whiff of spewed sewage.,"The themes of this story are not just localized to Korea, however. They are the story of global capitalism, and the specter of American materialism (and imperialism; note the ""Indians"") looms heavily over the film. Meritocracy makes cannibals of us all. It's nice to dream, and sometimes the dreamers who plan and struggle well enough can indeed climb out of the basement and into the sunshine, and how nice an ending it is when they do. But the film also makes it clear that sometimes all that planning and dreaming may be, maybe, just whims and fancy. More often, it seems, our pipe dreams are content to leave us with nothing more than the whiff of spewed sewage.

The film was incredibly entertaining too. I can't think of a boring scene in this movie and yet on the surface for large parts of the film you would say not a lot is happening, at least in terms of action. Fascinating characters and brilliant dialogue are what create this.","Dec 15, 2024"

6,Simple Scenario,"""Parasite"" is a cinematic masterpiece that seamlessly blends genres to deliver a thought-provoking and socially relevant narrative. Bong Joon-ho's direction is impeccable, crafting a visually stunning and emotionally charged film. The performances, particularly by the ensemble cast, are exceptional, capturing the nuances of class struggle with depth and authenticity. The film's dark humor adds a layer of complexity, making it both entertaining and intellectually stimulating. The meticulously designed sets and cinematography enhance the storytelling, creating a palpable atmosphere. ""Parasite"" challenges societal norms and explores the consequences of economic disparity in a compelling and unpredictable manner. It's a riveting exploration of the human condition that lingers in the mind, solidifying its place as a modern cinematic classic.","Jan 1, 2024"
6,"Brilliant, except the end...","This film has one of the most compelling premises and buildups in of any film in recent years.

However, the ending left me rather cool and I felt that a story with such a gripping narrative should have something a little more well thought out.

It's almost as if there is a genre switch near the end of the film. Where it goes from psychological drama to cartoonish over the top horror. I'm interested to know if there was studio intervention on this point because it almost feels like another filmmaker took over.

Unfortunately, this bend basically broke the reality of the film for me. But the primary build up of the film is so great its still definitely worth a watch.","Sep 26, 2023"
6,For those who gave this movie 10/10,"This film started well and I liked the opening dialog and the concept, but this film is simply not worthy of a Best Picture Oscar. There were too many disjointed scenes and bad editing. I think I need to see some more of this directors other films. I watched Okja and thought it was poor, so not sure what all the hype is about. 6/10 No doubt it will be remade Hollywood stylie but I wont be bothering to see it.","Apr 20, 2020"
6,Detritivores,"Oscars best picture, Cannes winner, lauded and acclaimed, and a good and engaging film from beginning to ending. Good in most respects but mainly it has a catchy hook. An engaging premise. A peculiarity in its treatment of subject and theme.

I would not agree that such novelty of idea makes, by itself, for an award winning finished film and certainly in this case I am fairly confident that the film as a whole is much less than the ""vigor"" of its animating conceit; it's 'reason to be' (made).

Ancient issues of human inequality of life invested with a catchy and up to date arrangement is a neat idea, hardly groundbreakingly original in world cinema, but it's a neat idea.

Essentially a pursuit, in dramatic film, of the degree to which ""upstairs-downstairs"" conditions the life choices, circumstances and outlooks of people caught on opposite sides, how it warps and differentiates lives lived to ultimately decide whole human lives without their own input.

This ""have and have nots"" and ""how the other half lives"" drama is not new and indeed it has precursors in western and eastern film and broader fiction.

The manner of this drama is in two stages: firstly the ingratiating ""invasion"" of the rich households retinue by the Kim family; eventually completely usurping the established retainers and then secondly the heightening of the old household staff reappearing and ultimately revolting against their disposition; all transpiring almost entirely under the noses, and beneath the awareness of the ""upstairs"" 'haves', the Park family.

That's it. That's the best idea. The enervating treatment of an old dramatic theme of rich and poor.

It's a good film in its runtime: reasonably written except in certain unbelievable characters and relationships; an insistence on a highly risky full assault on employment opportunities by the Kim family that I baulked at whilst watching; and a missed opportunities to illuminate the 'host' family of 'upstairs': the Parks.

The acting was usually reliable although few actors were required to display much range in their performance. A major problem was scenes of drinking, 'drunk' acting was unconvincing.

Direction and editing were certain if uninspiring. Technical virtues included a sympathetic use of sound design and a well chosen pallet of colours plus an interesting main location at the Park's house.

Certain limitations in writing include the Kim daughters character, who I found utterly unconvincing and unbelievabile as presented: she is intelligent, resourceful, outgoing, manipulate, skilled and also beautiful, young, female and single.....and yet none of this seems remotely relevant to the young woman we meet at the films inception...was she being kept in a freeze dried bag until the day before the narrative opens? How can she exist in her environment without these character details having very pertinently pressed upon her life? As the film proceeds she serves to help other family characters but otherwise she is a doll in a costume after that.

The Kim mother is barely recognizable as a full human character with genuine characteristics and a independent life. Her marriage is seldom testified to, is it good to bad, or bad to good, how do they feel to each other and about each other, what little closenesses do they share unique to them....I dunno. Compared to the Kim men the two females are badly nourished as characters and conspicuously so in the case of the daughter.

The Park's family hints having real human people in it but by the end of the film even the husband, who seems quite human at times, is left uninteresting and unconsidered. The idea that they have a real life with skeletons in cupboards was absent. Only the phrasing of the husband to relate about his main encounters with the Kim's father to his wife, with phrases about ""crossing the line"" and ""subway people"" seemed to expand their humanity.

There are 3 marriages featured in the film plus a teenage relationship and only the third and final couple, of the displaced housekeeper, actually seem to have a ""lived in"" married life that feels like it proceeds the story concerning the film.

The full attack upon maximum employment by the Kim family seemed to me to be an extremely ungainly insistence for the film to impose on my disbelief but it had to do it to develop it's plot line.

Finally, in passages the film hints at metaphorical depths such as its talking about ""light"", it's use of rain storms and catastrophic floods, underground dwellings and the rock ""scholars stone"". These metaphors interact with the upper class airy people and the ground dwelling lower class people: but here I would have appreciated some 'second unit' type environmental photography to tie the human story with the metaphorical levels with the films physical reality. I'd have accepted an extension of the runtime to achieve this extra footage on the edit.

In summation I rate at a lowish 6/10 and I would reserve my agreement that this film deserves such rewards as it has garnered for what is basically a neat idea for a particular treatment of standard themes and subject matter which is amiably delivered on screen but suffers from varied failures in execution in the writing.","Feb 28, 2020"

6,Oy...,"I decided to take a look, only after more than a hundred reviews, and probably in vain. Moreover, it's a shame that some reviews are fictitious. Simply put, many did not watch the film, but rewrote publicly available information about it on the web, not knowing what it was really about. I have nothing against this movie, but it's a one-off, as for me, and I'm unlikely to remember it in detail in a couple of months.

6,Parasite: Is there Really a Such Thing in the Human Definition?,"When people think of a parasite, they obviously associate it with a lesser living creature living off of its larger, more prosperous host. For example, fleas live on dogs and consume their blood.

According to society, which is constructed in a way that the most educated are burdened with defining the meaning of words, a parasite is a person who consumes resources off of another without returning anything. At least so it says, right?

Well, what if an economic recession hits and people lose their jobs and no longer have a way of making the money they need to in order to repay whoever it is they are working for? What if they experience an illness, injury, or health problem (in addition to that bad economic situation) which deems them unable to even work productively (at least for a while)? What if the ""host"" that the so-called ""parasite"" human is borrowing resources from is actually a ""bad person"" themselves who ""abuses"" them both emotionally, verbally, and physically in order to boost their ""egos"" to make themselves feel superior to the person they are ""helping""?....Is there actually a parasitic human, or are all people just human?

Take for instance someone who is born into poverty, physically or mental abuse, or both. Are they parasites just because of this? Things they had no control over? Just because they are poor? What if this person decides to not make excuses and gets a job, but a recession hits that causes them to lose their job? Were they not a parasite before but now after they lose their job, which they cannot help, they are now?

Perhaps most complexly, what if they people ""at the top"" are actually the ""Parasites""? (if there was one). Isn't it true that government workers and ""politicians"" live off of ""taxpayer money"" (aka taxpayer labor)? Isn't it true that a mega-rich corporate leader consumes the labor of their subordinates in order to make exponentially more money off of them?

Doesn't this luxurious CEO or executive ""suck the blood"" and ""life"" out of their workers by forcing them to work harder, work overtime, sometimes work 60 hours a week or more (with the threat they will be demoted or lose their jobs if they do not)? And isn't it true that due to increase production or productivity, the executive makes even more money on the backs of their employees? Furthermore, cannot the corporation hold onto the laborers' paychecks for at least 2 weeks in order to reinvest it in stocks before paying it out to those who earned it two weeks prior as they wait for their paychecks?

Many years ago, a very startling and eye opening book came out which actually compared corporations to psychopaths. All of the traits in an empirical psychopath are parallel to exactly how corporations are run, and also how corporate executives operate: they callously mistreat their employees, can care less about their health or well being as long as they are greedily and selfishly getting wealthier and growing. As a corporation becomes bigger, the dichotomy between caring for a small group of employees and eventually becoming indifferent to any humanity and well being of the individuals (which also includes the customers) becomes starker in contrast. All that matters is personal selfish gain in an overabundance unnecessary amount of riches, as their employees struggle to pay their bills each pay period and have to wait two weeks often times for their checks. If they lay people off or if the corporation downsizes or relocates, then the employees are back to barely getting by with no check.

So the question again must be asked: who ""really"" is the Parasite? Either there are none, or everyone is.","Feb 13, 2020"
6,Over-hyped,"A hard up Korean family slyly manipulate themselves into different jobs working for one wealthy family.

The story takes an unexpected turn when a visitor arrives.

This movie received a lot of good hype and it makes a social commentary. It's very well made but ultimately I did not really like the whole story being told. Not sure I would recommend.","Aug 14, 2022"
6,Well made but too impactful,"Very well made film. It was very thrilling and each scene had you wondering what was coming next. The ending with the violence was disproportionate to the very well crafted first 3/4s off the film. After it has you feeling a bit disturbed, well made but the ending was too violent for good taste.","Jun 30, 2021"
6,Not good Not bad,It was not that good and not that bad for me. It's quite boring in middle of the movie but at the end it was good.,"May 25, 2021"
6,Direction and Logic,"After all the hype I came away from this film terribly disappointed. I gave it 6/10 because the beginning captured me, then sadly the whole plot got lost in the brutality. I have seen better films about Rich and Poor come out of South Korea. Sadly this is not one of them.

The story lacked good direction, and logic. It felt like the writers were struggling with the whole flow of the plot. Not something I could recommend as a must see.","Jun 3, 2021"
6,What was that?,"I was dying to watch this movie with a point like this but' it just doesn't deserve this score. If Inception is 8,6 this movie had a 7,5 with a good perspective. The movie got really meaningless every minute. It ended so ridiculous, ""Oh, I have a plan. Let's make us rich."" Wow, why didn't you do that before? It can be enjoyed very hard but never gets this score.","May 7, 2021"
6,Parasite sucks itself dry.,"Kim K'atek and his near do well family literally living in the lower depths catches a break when their son obtains employment as a tutor for a wealthy family. Craftily the family conspires to inveigle its way into the household of the Parks by getting the chauffeur and longtime housekeeper fired and setting themselves up inside the lavish domicile with a Garden of Eden for a front yard. Things quickly take a turn however when the housekeeper returns for something she left behind.

Working with basically two class defining sets Parasite is a well filmed an interesting watch with the plot slowly unfolding in a darkly comic fashion before going into self induced chaotic free fall from the plausible to the absurd with a hurried climax and unsatisfying epilogue. Director Joon Ho-Bong and cinematographer Kyong pyo Hong do an excellent job of contrasting settings, situations, jabs about class and characters early, equally dividing the roles of his adult characters all benign and petty in their own way. It adds to the fascination of where this slightly off balance plot is going when the wheels come off. With no end game to the plot Ho-Bong decides to end it in conflagration and an insipid post climax that demands it defy logic.","Nov 13, 2019"
6,The most overrated film on IMBD,"Don't get me wrong, it's ok, but the critic and user reviews are truly astounding. It's spoken about like it's some marvel of cinema, when in reality is a mediocre story, heavily laden with obvious ""social and financial injustice"".

It'll pass an afternoon, it won't stay with you forever.","Feb 6, 2022"
6,"If The Movie Was Made In America, Everyone Would Think It Was Average","It's a Will Ferrell comedy. Yep, a Will Ferrell comedy.

""Poor family outsmarts a clueless, out-of-touch rich family and takes over the house"" is absolutely a Will Ferrell comedy plot.

Ignore how beautiful the movie looks: the poor family's cramped, dirty house and the rich family's pristine, futuristic house.

Ignore the fact that it's a foreign film: There must be a least a few people who LOVED the film because it's in a different language and liking the film makes them smart.

If this was a Will Ferrell movie or a Steve Martin movie and it had the same dialogue and zany schemes, you would think the movie was average. Or maybe even terrible. One scene included the daughter leaving her underwear in the rich parents' car to trick them into thinking the driver had sex in it.

Maybe the Will Ferrell/Steve Martin comparison is a little bit melodramatic. My point is, if you set aside the fact that it's an immensely well made foreign film (on a technical level!), Parasite is weak when it comes to characters and storytelling.

There are no memorable characters in this movie (except for maybe a character that showed up near the end of the film, but only because he was so over-the-top). A perfect example is the poor family. They're basically the same person.

For the most part, the rich couple are the usual snooty, dimwitted suburban snobs we've seen in plenty of mainstream garbage comedies.

Most of the story is just the exchange between the poor family and the rich family. The back-and-forth between them was interesting, but definitely not Oscar-worthy.

It's a bit difficult to rate the acting if the movie is in a different language. As far as I can tell, the acting was just okay. No groundbreaking performances. Just people sitting (or standing) around and talking with a few wacky comedic moments.

Oh and there's a murder at the end that feels out of place.

Obviously, movie isn't terrible. The visuals were incredible. The scene where the poor family's neighborhood was consumed by a flood was gorgeous.

I enjoyed the film, but I wouldn't say it's the greatest film ever.","Mar 8, 2021"

6,I don't get it...,"Maybe I'm dumb. But given that this movies on paper is a masterpiece to me (I'm a big fan of Memories of Murder and Chaser ) but as execution, I feel like I'm fed a messege. And that broke the fourth wall for me.

The first half is masterfully plotted and acted and directed. It could have just stuck to this story and the eventual clash with the rich family. But the plot in the basement and the overall comic tone in the second half, it lost me.

It lost me even more that it's hailed as a masterpiece for Oscar. It's plain to see that Oscars have a political or some kind of Agenda. I mean over the years there has been foreign masterpieces that no one even considered in Oscars.","Jul 16, 2021"
6,parasite,"The film's story was excellent and the characters the director tried to convey were great, but he didn't deserve a Best Picture award.

Movie won the oscar, still I would vote Tumbbad compare to Parasite. 10 stars for the acting. First 1hrs felt little slow, overall 6 points.","May 13, 2020"
6,Not for me,"I don't know, I wasn't very impressed. The beginning was rather a drag, I did like the plot in the middle, but it fell apart quickly for me and it crashed at the birthday party. Watchable, because it's unpredictable, but too hyped I guess or maybe it's just not my style.","May 9, 2020"
6,Full of intrigue.,"Parasite (2019) -

I probably wouldn't have gone anywhere near this film if it hadn't featured on the up to date IMDB Top 250 films and personally I would have kept 'Snow White And The Seven Dwarves' (1937) from their Top 100 list and left this one off, but it wasn't a bad film at all.

I could see the appeal in this one, because it managed to be a little bit of everything, all in just one film. It was clever how the ""Poor"" family manipulated the ""Rich"" family and that element to start with was quite witty, but then things went in a different direction and all sorts of drama, horror and thrilling styles came in to play.

I can only really compare it to 'From Dusk Till Dawn' (1996) in that respect, having had no idea of the twist that occurred in that one either. I'm not saying that there are definitely Vampires, but there could be. And actually anything could have happened as the story progressed with secrets and events that I hadn't even considered at the outset.

The only other film that I could see similarities to would be 'The Handmaiden' (2016), also from South Korea and a film where things weren't always as they seemed either.

I'm not sure how good the acting was in this one, because I find it really difficult with foreign language films to feel the emotion and that is certainly the case with Asian stories with their exaggerated humour elements akin to Anime or sometimes even those crazy Japanese game shows where the contestants are basically repeatedly tortured in a 'Krypton Factor' (1977-2013) style, but without the health and safety people on hand.

I think the ""Rich"" Mum, Yeon Kyo was probably a bit over the top, although she appeared to fit quite well as the film progressed.

Ultimately, what started out as quite a lighthearted and cheeky hustle film, very quickly became something severe and psychotic that was very dark and twisted in some very odd directions. I wouldn't say that I didn't like it, but I felt that there was a translation issue, although it did seem far easier to liken it to cinema of British or U. S. origin than others I've watched.

It really would be hard to quantify as one type of film, but I suppose it would be best classed as a dark dramatic comedy?

635.67/1000.","Oct 16, 2022"
6,Bit of a Stinker Unfortunately,"10/10 for acting, cinematography, and plot development

1/10 for the second half

This had the potential to resolve itself epically but instead quickly descended into a messy free fall of nonsense.

There are so many intensely gripping Korean films I was sure this would be one of them. And for the first half I was engrossed. But the second half was a huge let down.

The acting and production quality are fantastic but the resolution sucks. No spoilers.

Watch the original Old Boy again, or The Chaser instead. This film has nothing but disappointment at the end.

Boring.","Dec 12, 2019"
6,"Original, but overrated","The movie itself isn't too bad. It's worth watching if you want something different from what you're used to watching. The story-line is good, it really makes you pay attention on little things, but it's also too simple.Acting was amazing, but I didn't like the directing. Maybe it was just directed in a unique way that not everyone will find its true value, but for me it was boring. In my personal opinion, this movie is kinda overrated.","May 8, 2020"
6,Not Oscar worthy - but better than the other nominees,"So far I've watch Jo Jo Rabbit, Joker, The Irishman, Once Upon A Time In Hollywood, and Parasite. Parasite deserves the win because it's only out of those movies(plus a few I haven't seen yet) but that's grading on a curve. It's not a great film. It's cliche and has some bizarre plot lines that are interjected as a way out of obvious plot holes (plus some cheap entertainment value). Curiously absent from the Oscar nominations was Uncut Gems which I found to be more entertaining and powerful than Parasite and the others(almost passed over watching that one but decided to give it a go because Adam Sandler hasn't been funny in 15 years anyway so let's see him in a drama - he was brilliant).","Apr 8, 2020"
6,Good But Overrated,"Interesting story, good acting and very good directing.

It was far overrated for what it was and it's sad that something this average gets accolades for the sake of promoting inclusivity. It certainly was worth a watch but it didn't deserve any awards.","Nov 13, 2021"
6,Not what I expected,"The great thing about this movie is that rich people actually do nothing wrong. The husband and wife are loving, the children are gratifying, there is no derailment, there is no cold violence, there is no child abuse, and the driver and the servant are generous. Judging from the movies, they are stupid and have more money. They do not have their own main ideas. They are turned around by the poor, as if to play a role in highlighting the poor.","Apr 3, 2020"
6,Gripping but foreseeable,"While Parasite had great cinematography and was gripping from start to finish, the movie lacked proper closure and wasn't executed greatly. The conclusion lacked any relation and was uneventful. This movie which so ""profoundly"" tries to highlight social class differences, failed in creating a movie with a logical ending and turned into a sappy melodrama almost painful to watch.","Feb 21, 2020"
6,well made.,"The movie is so like realistic and entertaining, I love the suspense and the acting is good and the story is so good. It has a message to tell and the surprise is 50/50 kinda expected it but I like the overall movie.","Feb 19, 2020"
6,Made for USA market I think,"I found this film to be trying to cover too much time in one film. You cannot convey depth and soul in such a rush. It was a check list of trying to be quirky, deep, etc. It did not work. I previously saw 3iron and that blew me away. This film has a very high score and I do not understand why. It is overtly formulaic. No character is given enough time to become anything you can relate to really. It is a hurry and that does not work for something like this. It is like Indie film for mainstream mind. I was not moved by it.","Jun 7, 2020"
6,Overrated,"Fairly well told story of struggles, hardships and fantasies of south korean lower middle class. Draws some pertinent inferences to cruel class differences capitalism creates and flourishes upon. Attention to details and proximity to reality remains comendable for the first couple of hours and then comes the disastrous climax. The irrational, abrupt, unjustified and plot defying actions of the characters in the dramatic last scene will surely spoil the mood. The climax will also reveal grave weaknesses of the plot which cant help leading to an inevitable low key ending.","Feb 14, 2020"
6,I'm being fair with a 6; 7 would have been generous,"Nothing special. Decent, but could have cast more actors that didn't look like they were acting. Kang-ho Song (Ki Taek) and Hye-Jin Gang (Chung-Sook) were great. Not one scene of theirs looked forced. Can't say that about anyone else as they all had moments where they looked like they were ""acting"".

I understand the metaphorical meaning and depth of the film which made it decent. I can handle ""can't-place-it-in-just-one-genre"" idea. However, there just is not enough there to make it Best Picture of the year. The powers that be were reaching to award something just to make their own point I think. It's not even in the same category as Joker and I typically don't like films that are gloomy and 70's-ish looking, but Joker was much better and was even similar to Parasite in some of it's lessons on humanity. I'm not saying Joker should be Best Picture either because I didn't see hundreds of movies last year to make that call, but it was the best I saw in 2019. If you can either understand the spoken language of Parasite or don't mind reading subtitles, then it's worth seeing--partially for the meaning, partially to say you saw it, partially so you can see for yourself that an ok movie can win Best Picture. Tune out the idea that you'll watch a comedy or a drama or a thriller or a horror movie--its a blending of a lot of things.","Apr 21, 2020"
6,Kinda dissapointed me.,"When i went to see this film, i was expecting to see if all the reviews saying it being the year's best film were true. Well, i didn't hate this movie, but there was just something about it i didn't like. I don't know what it was, really. The plot was really interesting and well written, the characters were were good, but it was just something about the second act that threw me away. I'm pretty sure everyone else will love it, but i just think it's a bit overrated.","Feb 19, 2020"
6,"Pretty good, but hyped more than necessary","Don't get me wrong, it's a good movie. I just don't see why it's soooo hyped. On the other hand, I appreciate this type of dark comedic movie getting recognition even if by the Academy. I stopped watching the awards years ago because the movies are sooo predictable or pretentious or big budgety but not a lot of soul. So by that standard, and the fact it introduces more people to the awesome world of Korean cinema, this movie is really good.

The story is great, the characters were fun and you got to know each, and the acting was spot on. The settings were great as wel.

I thought it was a sci fi flick, but I truly knew nothing about it. I was expecting a thriller like Bug or The Fly or something weird like that. What I got was not disappointing. Very quirky which reflects the work of the director who brings an interesting flare to movies. He's definitely developed his signature style and I think it will make people visit this portfolio.

Again, very good movie. But won't change your life. It may stick with you a little afterwards, but it will fade so you can move on to the next.","May 10, 2020"
6,Seriously Overrated !,Did i just watched a different movie ? I don't Know after reading all reviews i was quite excited and had hopes on this film.

6,PLEASE ... who got paid for their 10 star rating?,"Why is it that foreign, sub-titled movies, get a higher rating? This was just a plain dumb movie. All hype - no substance.

6,A good movie but 4 Oscars good?,"Parasite 6/10... very well made movie but is it the first Korean movie the academy have seen??! The oscars throwing best international movie, best director, best screenplay and best motion picture at this movie just goes to prove my theory that the Academy are so out of touch and so desperately want to appear ""woke"" and this action by them is just an insult to all the great Korean movies that have come before this and all the other great movies released in the last year. For me this was an above average South Korean movie but everyone latched onto it as some kind of miracle of modern cinema... Meh academy, meh!","Feb 18, 2020"
6,I'm baffled by the over the top praise.,"The film is interesting, but that's about it. The first hour was really slow, the whole class thing seemed quite familiar. I'm not sure why people are falling over themselves about this film, maybe since it was Korean yet with an accessible story and familiar film language that it suddenly moved westerners to 'see the light'? Anyway, the second half twists and turns struck me more as a wacky story line I would have seen on a soap opera back in the day like Young and the Restless or Days of our Lives. Overall, I'm more critical of the critics than of the film. I recommend seeing this, it's worth a look but all the Oscars and 'best film of the decade' stuff is incomprehensible.","Feb 19, 2020"
6,"Daring, original, but doesn't quite hang together","I've often thought that the genre mix of comedy - thriller is the most difficult to bring off. Somehow the two different kinds of reality, in their extremes, don't mix easily, unless the very nature of the narrative demands it, as in Dr Strangelove.

The comic first half is somewhat slow, and deals with the infiltration of a wealthy but naïve family, by a streetwise poor one. However, when the action develops along more serious lines in the second half, the atmosphere created in the first half still carries a surreal edge, and so I couldn't believe in the subsequent action sufficiently to be thrilled or horrified.

A brave attempt, but in the end I was left feeling a bit numb. It all seemed to lack any solid centre, with serious themes looking trivial, and comic themes looking disturbing rather than entertaining. All a bit tasteless, really.","Feb 29, 2020"
6,Overrated,OK movie. Don't really see why people are claiming that it the director is always one step ahead. I personally felt that it was unrealistic and therefore had little sympathy for both sides of society.,"Feb 16, 2020"
6,Watched because of the hype,"I only watched this coz of the hype, but it was just an okay movie. I didn't find the story that interesting, especially how they got so greedy. ""Jessica"" quoted some big figures for her pay, I really thought that would have made a difference in their lives, but it seems all the money went to was food, coz thats all that changed in their lives. They started eating at a better place. And it really took a dark turn at the end.","May 14, 2020"
6,slightly above average thriller,"Has nothing special going for it. Sure, it's good at times but there's a lot of thrillers out there that are good at times and most of them don't get a tenth of the praise this movie got.

Slow, mildly interesting first act. Thrilling second act. And the third act feels a bit try-hard with and an almost ON YOUR FACE piece of social commentary, and a 25th Hour rip-off of an ending.

All in all, it's not a bad film by any account, but it's certainly not as good as everyone's making it to be.","Apr 29, 2021"

I think that the primary Oscar should have gone to The Irishman, or Once upon a time... In Hollywood, or 1917 (Nineteen seventeen), or Mr. Jones, or Dark waters, or The lighthouse, or Sorry we missed you, or Richard Jewell Glass, or even Downton Abbey - the motion picture.

Bad: the second half of the film. Ugly: the overflowing toilet.

The first half of the movie was magical. The storyline and setup were unique, credible and crisp. Then, it all fell apart. The punchline was a low blow at best. Too many pratfalls, way too surreal, overly silly and sadly pretentious. As a member of the (target?) audience I felt cheated. It should have been so much more and could have been with very little tweaking and tightening. Bottom Line: Parasite does not deserve the Best Picture Award or the Best Director Award from the Academy, period.","Jan 18, 2020"

Well it's not one of them. The only question this movie leaves you with is: ""What is this"" and the only though is ""I just wasted 2 hours and 12 minutes of my life"". The whole movie doesn't have a flow, is so predictable in the first part, like they try to put oh the poor vs the rich, phrases like 'oh he smells like underground'.

5,mediocre and forgettable,"Parasite is in my opinion a very Korean movie. What do I mean with that? Well, I will get into that late, but firstly; it was directed by Bong Joon-ho, who is best known for his English language movies ""Snowpiercer"" and ""Okja"". Both movies while being overall pretty overdramatic and simple, they at least try to have an atmosphere. They also have a clear message, which however show a very naïve perspective on reality. Even his previous Korean language movies like ""mother"" and ""the host"" are very similar in that fashion. ""Parasite"" however doesn't really show much of that regard. Neither does it have a clear message nor any sort of atmosphere, which in my opinion is very reminiscent of many of the Korean movies I have seen (with the exception of the masterpieces ""Burning"" and ""April snow""). ""Parasite"" however does have an interesting idea behind it which makes it in my opinion the most bearable of the Bong movies. But that's the only thing good about the movie however, maybe besides the production value. The movie has nice set design and has some good shots in it. It is lacking in many other departments however. The characters, for example are terribly written. They are basically shallow and in some cases only 1 dimensional exaggeration of a single character drope making the movie sometimes feeling dragging and boring, because of its focus on the characters. The soundtrack is lacking with only a few classical pieces and they are not really well placed in the movie in order to create atmosphere, often time being played behind dialog conflicting with the exposition scenes (which shows that the production value wasn't well spend in all places). The acting is decent, considering the director. Nothing bad, but also nothing extraordinary. The story consists of many plot conveniences and a lot of shock factor which ruins the whole idea behind it and makes it very confusing.

So overall I would say this movie was pretty mediocre, that's why I said its pretty Korean. It had a nice idea but doesn't do much with it and only uses it for shock value. It has very uninteresting character and sometimes feels very boring because of it. It is ultimately a very forgettable movie and the only reason I will probably remember it is because it is overhyped by many (kinda like the Korean movie ""Oldboy"")","Dec 1, 2019"
5,Ridiculously hyped,Why this modern day soap opera even won the best picture at oscars its a no no in a million years for me. 5 stars for the exceptional acting though,"Aug 2, 2020"

5,Overrated,Good film but not an oscar... or not should be an oscar!,"May 5, 2020"
5,Highly overrated,"I really don't understand what they see in this movie. It's good at most. It is not an original theme, it is not believable as a story, it is slow and it does not entertain. People are very hypocritical to praise a mediocre work of art so highly. Without any doubt or fear of being wrong, this movie does NOT deserve the academy award.

The film has the opportunity to develop stories and is left with superfluous scenes. It tries to tell the injustices that a family of employees receives and, honestly, it fails to move the viewer. I find it extremely strange that so many people have praised a film that is far from innovative. The script is bad, at the very least, it could have told a story ten times better. I'm genuinely surprised at the rave reviews this mediocre movie is getting.","Oct 30, 2022"
5,Overrated movie,Complicated with less meaning. Briefly not what I was expected at all.,"Mar 25, 2020"
5,Man is this overrated,I don't understand how this movie won the academy award for best picture? Its okay at best..the whole we're trying to make a statement about the rich and poor needing each other to survive is nonsense..these were bad people it had nothing to do with them being poor. If this had been an English speaking film it barely would've gotten a second look...,"May 8, 2020"
5,"A South Korean ""Tarantino"" overrated film.","I watched the film without any knowledge of anyone's critic or rating. I got into the interesting plot of the beginning with much more curiosity for the direction it could drive me to. However, I was disapointed when blood began to flow everywhere unnecessarily, without serving any purpose. I am not a Tarantino's fan, that's for sure. In the end I could not realize if class struggle or social inequality aspects of our society should be told on screen in such a confusing way. Or was it simply a flat thriller? I did not quite get it. Surely overrated though.","Jan 2, 2020"
5,Over hyped,"To begin with I'm not a fan of Bong Joon-ho. I discover this almost by accident because I had no idea that he was behind Snowpiercer and the Netflix produced, Okja. I couldn't get through the first one and I fell asleep during the second. I gave this one a shot even though I knew that hyped movies are not my cup of tea. They seem to be self-reliant on the hype they generate, that somehow should be enough to reassure us, they'll leave us with an unforgettable memory.

So while this movie isn't bad and technically well-made, is far from unforgettable. It's heavy-handed and pushes the device of the screwball comedy far enough to make its subversion and consequent transformation into carnage, less plausible. A mechanism very dear to French director Francois Ozon, who Bong Joon-ho seems to be definitely indebted to.

A movie that certainly pleases the crowds with its grotesque and cynical satire and its deliberate use of violence. To quote Calvino: ""What many consider to be the vitality of the times - noisy, aggressive, revving and roaring - belongs to the realm of death, like a cemetery for rusty old cars.""","Jul 17, 2020"
5,Sadly I felt it was overrated.,"After watching this ""masterpiece"", I felt as if there was missing something, or a major twist was left out. I was told by plenty of people, that you would be amazed about the twists, and there would be a lot of surprises. Which sadly didn't happen, and I really felt that it was missing that huge ""WHAT!?"" feel, which never came. Everything was so predictable, and there wasn't as much comedy as expected. I wouldn't see it again, but I'm good now that I have seen it tho.","Jul 22, 2020"
5,It's Terrible !!,"Are u serious? This movie not deserve the best movie oscar. I think "" oscar goes to 1917 ""..","Mar 12, 2020"
5,Definitely overrated for some obscure reason,"Here is why I think this movie is overrated:
The characters are unconvincing. Given that they all have an eye for exploiting other people for money, how did they become so poor in the first place, unless there was some kind of sudden divine inspiration? And is uncouth behavior all the working class would like to achieve once given the opportunity to become rich?
Although the movie seems to be compassionate with the poor as a first impression, it does the au contraire from a class perspective. The naive and gullible rich are defrauded by the covetous poor! Shouldn't be like, the rich are covetous so they have become rich?
The acting is mediocre if not bad compared to other Korean movies such as Handmaiden or 3-iron.
All in all, it is a so-so movie which nobody will lose anything if not watches.","Jan 30, 2021"
5,"Interesting plot, good acting, very weird and almost completely devoid of everything I love about Korean Television","In the last few years I pretty much exclusively watch Korean television (apart from a few good Chinese dramas) and this is why... Incredible story telling, brilliant acting and an ability to create a story where warmth, kindness, humility, villains, tragedy and decency are skilfully blended into a story that takes you on a journey with enough realism and fiction to leave you satisfied and happy. They don't have to be rom coms, it doesn't seem to matter what the genre, most (of course not all) leave you not just entertained but are thought provoking too.

With this in mind and all the hype and awards this film received, I felt that I should watch it.

I can take weird, some parts of many K dramas are a bit weird but in a good or at least tolerable way. It wasn't that I didn't understand what the writer was trying to convey, I just felt it was all over the place, with no actual storyline. K dramas are not like US or UK dramas, they are basically one long film divided into episodes which allows complex characters, touching and thought-provoking moments and interesting story lines to develop. For this reason, the film felt really short to me. I'm so disappointed. The acting was good but I felt the sofa scene and ending in very poor taste not to mention the unbelievable recovery of the son! I think I will stick to my well selected K dramas and definitely avoid this writer from now on. Don't judge all Korean television by this drama unless of course you loved it which surprisingly many seem to.","May 3, 2021"
5,Average,"I didn't think this film was particular good it's not as smart as it thinks it is, the infiltration of the house was unrealistic and the so called twist was predictable. The oscars have no credibility these days.","Aug 4, 2020"
5,ParasitE,After all stories I was expecting a 8-9 rating movie. I was sad. Yes it's good for South korea but not for all world.,"May 21, 2020"
5,Not for me,"This movie just wasn't for me. It's very symbolic, which means you can interpret almost every scene and give it some special meaning. But at the end of the day it was such a strange movie with characters that weren't likable at all, and whatever message it tried to convey, it wasn't doing it in an appealing way. I feel like this is one of those movies suddenly everyone is talking about and so it became bigger than it deserved. And that comes from someone who admired Korean movies for almost a decade now.","Mar 17, 2020"
5,Original Story But Gets Silly,"The storyline here is original and interesting but unfortunately as the movie develops, it gets a bit silly. I'm not sure what the underlying message is, if any. Just a light comedy really I suppose. I certainly can't understand why it would have won the best picture Oscar in 2020.","Feb 17, 2020"
5,Overrated,Not bad but in no way Oscar winning stuff. The smell of the poor is a visceral punctum though.,"Apr 6, 2021"
5,Overrated and awful ending,The start was cool but turned out to be a more comedy movie instead of a drama. Despite being advertised. The film is highly unrealistic and beyond surprises.,"Feb 16, 2020"
5,Has this been rigged?,"This movie is barely mediocre. Usually IMDB and my tastes rank spot on, but this is the biggest chasm between our ratings. Terrible people, you don't want to like a single one, boring plot and even worse ending.","Nov 7, 2021"
5,one of those films that makes you wonder how the could mess it up,"Parasite is itself a parasite of a movie. The start is interesting and the cinematography is excellent throughout the film. It's a lot of fun seeing the street life of this poor family and their living conditions. There are some very unlikely manuplations involving job positions which are all too quickly accomplished and never entirely believable in their successful execution. What kills this film is the ridiculous second half of the movie and ending. This is It makes you wonder if they had a new writer finish the story up. One who just wanted to create an ending and had no concept of how to do it. Because there was some good acting and great film work, I gave it five stars. But it probably rates less due to bizaare and impossibly stupid parts to the movie.","Jan 6, 2020"
5,Truly over rated.,Looks great. Tired plot. If you didn't know what was going to happen you need to probably read some books or watch more movies. Something. Seriously.,"Jun 13, 2020"
5,Overrated,"Besides the storyline, all other aspects in this movie including actings, cinematography are good.. but for all the hype I thought it has a clever storyline.. but its not.. the development of the story depends on one silly mistake.. which for me a sign of a weak plot..

How could the whole family which could not even fold the pizza boxes properly could suddenly be shown as so good in what they do? And if they are really that good how come they could not get proper jobs at other places all these while?

And does the movie tries to tell us how selfish the rich people are and we should be emphatic to the poor?.. I did not get that at all.. its just a simple message that if you're a bad person, you're a bad person no matter whether you're rich or poor.. because its so obvious kim's family are greedy, selfish immoral people too..","May 17, 2020"

5,Germany-Switzerland fail,"I ki d of liked the movie at that point when I saw the Swiss magnets on the fridge and he started talking about German people living there... I watched the movie with English subs, so I hope in the original language they weren't making this huge fail.","Mar 25, 2020"
5,an upgraded version of a Tamil movie,The Korean version is more dramatic and have a cinematic feel to it. the script was fined tune and fused with universal themes that may also won it an Oscar.,"Dec 4, 2020"
5,Half of a great movie,"Overrated doesn't even begin to describe this film. I'm a fan of the director and am always excited when a new film of his is announced, and so it was with this film. Sadly, it does not deliver like his other works do. Performances are all uniformly excellent - particularly that of the poor family's father and the house maid of the rich family. Inventive camera work, a few chuckles here and there and a halfway point twist that makes you extremely uncomfortable and excited for where the story will go next and then...the story just takes a nose dive off of a cliff never to recover. As the film crawled towards its conclusion I couldn't wait to get out of the theater. By the time it's hoping to be ending arrives, I had already checked out. An interesting failure with a lot on its mind, but in the end, what's really underneath it all is a muddled point about class that isn't truly made. I would like for the film to have gone farther and darker than it did or to not have gone dark at all in the first place. This is a film that tries to be too many things at once and leaves you feeling cheated of seeing the movie you thought you were going to get. I keep thinking back to the one review blurb from the trailer (paraphrasing) ""a film that starts out as one thing and then becomes something entirely different"" - yeah, becomes a big stinker.","Oct 30, 2019"
5,Much ado about a lot less than pretended,"Korean satire about class differences turns into working class slapstick and pointless violence, that is, pointless relative to the point of the satire. The underlying dynamic is contemptuous of the poor and working class, and ends with a phony working class dream, under the guise of family. The last half or so of the film drags.","Jan 15, 2020"
5,Not Oscar worthy. Not even close,With all the hype around this film and winning the most prestigious award in film with the Oscar for best Picture I was expecting a lot more out of this movie. The story is great with a broke family hustling themselves into working for a rich family in Korea one job at a time was pretty good but the acting was very cartoonish to me. There's a lot of dialogue in this movie and sure it is a well-written script but these actors seem to just be reading the lines a lot of the time and not using their body language to really express the characters as much as I'm accustomed to through American film. I'm very disappointed in this movie and completely shocked that it won best picture. Surely there has to have been a better film made in 2019 than this? I give it 5/10,"Mar 18, 2020"
5,Classism exists. Period.,"It's a beautiful film, but it says nothing about class struggles and upward mobility that hasn't already been covered. I say this from a Western perspective, so I cannot speak to how the film was felt in South Korea. But as a Black American, I was... bored? I think the film's resonation with White American audiences speaks to this point even more. It won the Oscar because it is a criticism of Korea, not of America. We sit at a safe distance and revel in the ""bravery"" of the film because it allows us to ignore our own flaws. It is by no means a bad film. Just not a particularly interesting one.","May 15, 2020"
5,"Sadly, Woke Culture Comes to Korea","After watching the similarly overrated ""Host"" a couple years ago, I wasn't keen to jump on the bandwagon for this one. But so many people told me how ""amazing"" and different it was and kept recommending that I see it. So after it won all these awards and they put it back in my local theater I broke down and saw it. Well, that was a waste of $13.50 and two hours. It's billed as a genre bending comedy/drama, but in my opinion it misses on both fronts. There's nothing especially humorous in the dialogue or even the situations. Poor family scams rich family for jobs and money. Ooh, that's so original, except that it's not. The fact that the poor family is so unsympathetic makes it just unbearable. They're vile and annoying. Is it a clever commentary on class structure in Korea? Not really. Just hamfisted platitudes. The rich couple come off as far more likeable in fact. As for drama, there really isn't much. Yeah, they try to take a dark turn towards the end and there is a feeble attempt to make things dramatic, but I just kept looking at my watch wondering when this bore-fest would end. Then it just kept dragging on.

And for the record, I spend lots of time in Asia, including Korea. I've seen lots of Asian films. I have Asian relatives and an Asian spouse. It's not cultural misunderstanding here. I just think, like that similarly shallow representation of mental illness in the even more boring ""Joker"" film, people want to praise something that they think brings attention to some uncomfortable issue. Guess what? Variations of this class structure have existed in Korea for hundreds of years. Things are better now than they were. There are plenty of options that don't involve scamming and murder. But if you can feel better about yourself by claiming to empathize with the lower economic stratum by suffering through this film, more power to you.","Feb 17, 2020"
5,I honestly thought it was extremely overhyped.,"When I saw the raves about this movie, and saw how many Oscar's it won; I was more than intrigued. After viewing Parasite, I can say that it's not a bad movie by any means; I just don't see what everyone else does. I don't see how this movie achieved everything it has. Again I don't think it's a bad movie, but I don't think it is as great and amazing as everyone thinks it is.

I understand this is a very unpopular take, I don't want to turn anyone away, but I also don't think anyone should go in with high expectations, because it's possible that they will be disappointed like I was.

Like I said, it's not a bad film; but I personally don't think it's a 10/10 either.","Nov 22, 2022"
5,The concept and story's there but...,Talk about SLOW! This movie dragged for me and failed to keep me interested. I ended up turning it off after 20 minutes (surprised I made it that far). I read the synopsis off Wikipedia instead to see what the hype was about. I suggest y'all do the same. Not worth the 2 hours when you can read the synopsis in less than 5 minutes.,"Apr 23, 2020"
5,Overrated,"I watched Parasite on Prime Video, expecting it to be an above average film. It really was not.

The initial build up was too slow, the story thereafter was interesting but certainly not great cinema. It was just okay. The violence towards the end was too gory.

Overall, I found Parasite over rated.","Mar 30, 2020"

5,Overrated,What a shame Parasite won the Oscars instead of 1917. I was expected a masterpiece and felt really disappointed. It is like watching 2 different movies. Second half too surrealistic for my taste,"Mar 27, 2020"
5,Overrated,"From the first scene this movie reminded me of Almodovar, but without the required intelligent effort to make it a credible story. Metaphorical? Yes and no, that's where they lost me. The pace seems fast, but then I found myself wanting to fast forward a number of times, since the overly simplistic plot turn into absurd rather too quickly. If this is the best movie of the year then Hollywood has a very serious problem.","Mar 18, 2020"
5,Really don't understand the hype,"Based on some of the reviews I've read on IMDB, I'm not the only one who thought this film was definitely not worth the hype. Some parts were interesting but overall, I found it was just ... meh.","Feb 9, 2020"
5,Mediocre at best,"I'll keep it short as I don't want to waste too much time on this one. It's okay. No more no less. Okay to watch on a rainy Sunday, as I did, but at no point did it impress. It was quite boring at times although I did finish it with some effort. It's not a bad film but one thing is absolutely clear: it's unworthy of it's Best Movie Oscar! Don't know what the academy was thinking, but this is clueless..","Feb 15, 2020"
5,People going crazy like it's otherworldly!!!,"Just won Oscars cz concept was new, but this itself doesn't make it a better movie than Joker. Over hyped, Mediocre and people reviewing it in mob mentality. Nothing against Korean movies.","Mar 28, 2020"

5,Great ... until the end-game,"I see people really raving over the film and the awards it won, so I was keen to see it, sounded great. And it was great until about two thirds through when the ending kicks in.

The ending was just so-so, seemed to build up to a crescendo and then the plot let the actors down.","Jan 8, 2021"
5,Meh?! Did Nothing For Me.......... yet,"Inventive story, fair enough, great metaphors, obviously, but unfortunately, terrible acting. ""Mrs Park"" perhaps an exception, to the all round, wooden dourness of the performances. Was looking forward to seeing this, especially as it had been likened to ""Society"" the veritable 80's cult classic masterpiece, but I was left feeling well, pretty underwhelmed really, but hey, ho you can't have everything. However, maybe it'll grow on me over time!","Mar 3, 2021"
5,Pretentious garbage,"It appears this years theme is social injustice between lower and higher classes (Joker, this crap) . I was okay with this movie up until 3/4 . Now i have regret that I've wasted 2 hours of my life 13 dollars . And to think it won over Irishman and Once Upon A Time in Hollywood. I knew Oscars suck but this really is a final nail in the coffin.","Feb 17, 2020"
5,Exaggerated,All I wish to say is do not go by the rating or the hype. It is an average movie but with a slightly better storyline. There are way too many movies which are much much better.,"Mar 29, 2020"
5,Greatly overrated and thoroughly mediocre,"I don't have that much to say about this movie. It's too plain and mediocre. Nothing special about the story, nothing about the characters. The plot twist, if you may call it that, is weak at best. The decorations were built with great attention to detail, but they don't create any striking image. Except maybe the elevated toilet. But do you really think a toilet is enough to earn the praise that this movie gets? The parallel events that happen to the two families are very obviously parallel, you don't even have to watch the movie to see it. The title of the movie - yeah, we get that, who is actually the parasite, very subtle, haha. Ironically, this doesn't get more obvious after watching. The moral? Well, dubious at best. I hope they were not trying to justify the murder by the distaste to the smell of the people on the subway. But in this case, what is this movie about? It's kinda empty, has nothing to say. The actors play fine, nothing above or below average. Then, a few words about humor. This movie is listed as comedy. Yeah, it uses some typical comedic moves, like the impostor family hiding below the table. But none of those are funny. Most of these moments are just cringeworthy. I don't know if the director was going for this emotion, and even if he did it successfully, I'm not appreciating it. As a comedy, this film is far below mediocre. So what's the big deal about Parasite?","Jan 17, 2021"
5,i usually enjoy hyped movies. i find that in most cases- if its loved by a lot of people there is gotta be a reason,"However, not in this case. the cinematography is great and the actors are good. but what is so ""masterpiecey"" here? nothing. its a ""nice"" movie, that's it. is it possible that Hollywood is so obsessed with diversity that content is no longer an issue?","Feb 20, 2020"
5,"It told A story, nothing about people. That's all about the movie!","A story there was. Thrilling scenes there were. Some pretty cinematography yes. Solid character build-up, hell no. Logical plot, no. Entertainment, not much. Consistency of characters, missing. Petty resentful ignorance towards the rich, yes. Narrow and shallow depiction of the poor, very much.

So not convincing. Every stretch of the movie i thought I started understanding the characters a bit more, but no, next stretch would make me scratch that understanding and try to rebuild again.. In the end, it made me fail to attach with any of the characters.

Without enough entertainment, what were the film makers trying to tell the audience? I completely don't get it.

Really doesn't match the hype. Wasted two hours of my life.","Jan 4, 2020"

5,It's Baby's First Social Commentary! But Give Those Who Rave About It Some Slack,"This movie strongly reminded me of several different things as I watched it, the first was American Beauty. A film with a strong experiential component that is not matched by its actual message or ""literary"" value, and as such overrated in the moment and forgotten with time. Parasite is a very well composed and executed film, in terms of emotional engagement with the story and characters it gets you all dressed up and it's easy to feel as if you must have had somewhere to go. But you didn't.

The second was 'Let the Right One In'. That was a good movie that was basically rated 2 stars higher than it deserved by everyone in the United States because it had subtitles. Exotic and slightly more challenging to watch is easily conflated with quality by people who aren't especially self-perceptive in their thinking. Had Let the Right One In been in English and set in New York, well, the dumb and silly parts would have just seemed dumb and silly, and it would have had to stand entirely on its own quality, and not an imagined quality. Parasite is the same way. If it starred four American actors trying to get jobs as household help in LA, people would be quite meh about it. Actually given the nature of the plot, I think most people in America currently giving it a 10 would probably be a little insulted by screwball comedy plot that simultaneously seems to fawn over its own profundity, and would give it a lower rating than my 5 stars.

And third, this movie can't help but make me think of America's original class conscious, degenerately poor sitcom family, the Bundys from Married with Children. They even match by character: the intelligent but lame son, the beautiful but still poor sister who connives to get what she wants, the dead-eyed father crushed by life, and the ball-busting mother who really doesn't make anyone feel better. Just like the Bundy's they're comically poor while placed in a real life setting where anyone with their talents, willingness to work, and lack of any significant vices means they would at worst be regular poor. And probably decently well off.

They're also selectively stupid when required to be in order to make the plot work, which seems a little more forgivable in a weekly sitcom where the writers are forced to create drama dozens and dozens of times a year, but less so in a movie where they don't. The writers of Married with Children were also smarter in allowing their comedy to shoot for simply being funny, where here the slapstick situations lead to completely unfunny, dark, but still stupidly slapstick conclusions in a badly planned out gambit to give the movie ""meaning"".

Reading others' reviews, including some of the top ones on here, gives a good impression of why people liked this movie, as they discuss how it opened their eyes apparently to the relationship between the rich and their servants and perhaps the rich and poor in society generally. Which tells me that most of the people who really liked this film are for the most part, very inexperienced in life, and also not yet well read. I'm sure for someone with no first hand knowledge of the world and who hasn't delved into quality literature ever before, this is pretty profound stuff. It's easy to forget that if you're not just now crossing the starting line of life.

On the other hand, that hardly qualifies this movie as being great. If those who gave this movie a 10 are blown away by Parasite's subject matter, they need only head down to their local library and begin reading 19th century English literature to get a thousand times greater picture of what it is like for the serving poor and the separation between them and the rich. Victorian authors living in England included these basic facts of life out of course in their storylines without even meaning to have them signify some message, and if you liked that aspect of Parasite you'll quickly find the movie put to shame in its shallow depth of portrayal on the subject.

In the end what we really have is a dark comedy that misses it's own setup, and ends with a flailing attempt to create a message at the expense of creating a good story. It won't be the first Best Picture winner to lose its luster with every passing year as people look back upon it without hype and blindness for objective quality, but it at least is another to be added to the list.

5 out of 10 stars!","Feb 15, 2020"
5,"Overhyped, not that interesting and long","I'm sorry but I must be living on another planet - I can't understand why this film won an oscar and why some are rating it a 10. I felt a little bored in parts and I felt uncomfortable. Reading some other reviews after the film, maybe there were some aspects I hadn't analysed and worked out intellectually. But then still I felt it was totally over hyped.","Feb 18, 2020"
5,"Solid Film Craftsmanship, Trash Story","I'm genuinely baffled this film won not only best foreign film, best directing and best screenwriting, but also Best Picture (historically reserved for American films only). Of all the films to break the barrier and be the first, they chose THIS? When will all this self loathing end? I guess never because as long as humans are alive there will always be hordes of abysmally depressed people who think the more they hate humanity and the ways of the world they more self righteous they'll feel about ""calling it out"". What a joke. While the film is extremely well made its story is soulless and not as intelligent of a critique of capitalism, egalitarianism, and meritocracy as the snobs make it seem. At this point it's the ultimate cliche. It play more like a weak melodrama/soft noir movie. It's just a weird film that meanders and is only occasionally entertaining. Some good humor and interesting situations that hold you in brief suspense. Other than that the only interesting parts are seeing Korean culture in cinema. I'd love to visit some time. But this movie is trash. The overall message of the movie is life sucks, so why even try? It amazes me that the director can even reconcile the conflict within himself. I'm sure he tried VERY hard to make this a great movie, as he does with all his films. He tried so hard he even won 3 Oscar's with this one. He worked very hard for decades to gain the knowledge and skills to be able to pull this off and I know for a fact it's made him rich. Does he hate his own success? Should he have not ever tried and just remained a dreamer? Should he never have strove to be a great director? If he really feels this way about success and achievement he never should have accepted that Oscar. He should donate all his money to charity and live a destitute life because hey, life sucks for so many people, so why even try? Give me a break. The entire premise of the movie is JOKE. How immature and sad one must be to love this movie. 2 hours of life just wasted.","Feb 23, 2024"
5,If you are going to watch a foreign language film this is it,"I've never been a fan of watching sub titled foreign language film. It may be in part explained by not really associating with people who do enjoy foreign language films. Anyway with it's success at the Oscars, Parasite seemed to be deserving of a watch, so saw it on the big screen a couple of days ago.

Stylistically it seemed very similar to a Tarantino movie to me. The characters were gripping and the dialogue was excellent. Would have been so much more enjoyable if I understood Korean though. The movie explores the tensions in the class divide which is obviously a universal theme which everyone understands. The sets are excellent and so realistic you can imagine how you'd feel yourself yourself in the scenes.

It's well worth a watch and if you don't share my dislike of subtitles you'll probably love this movie.","Feb 25, 2020"
5,Reinforces what a joke the Oscars have become.,"The hype is simply because it's foreign and people, as usual, are jumping on the bandwagon. There's nothing great about this film. Don't say I didn't warn you.","Feb 22, 2021"
5,Parasite will go down like Crash and Forrest Gump as an Academy Mistake,"The directing is ameteurish compared to the other nominated directors. The story is interesting but not excessively. The characters are all paper thin and one dimensional. Their motivations and actions are not justified. E.g. the main murder is almost comically undeserved, serving only the useless final plot twist. Americans must not have seen any Korean movies before because this tone is very common. There was nothing exceptional about this film but it probably surprised American audiences with many aspects unfamiliar to them. That is the only reason I can imagine this won the academy award.

And best director? Really? No. Definitely not. Any director that can't justify major main character actions with his or her storytelling still needs some work,not an academy award.","Feb 24, 2020"
5,....,"The first of the movie was awesome, but the end is absurd","Jan 18, 2020"
5,"An ok movie, but...","An OK movie, but it's light years away from even being a nominee for Oscar not to mention wining it.","Feb 13, 2020"
5,completely overrated,"The high reviews for this movie say everything about the maturity of the critics and nothing about the so-called quality of this film. It's an average film. The story is mediocre and unoriginal. The humour is juvenile (exploding toilets tells you everything). The gore you'e definitely seen before. It is beautifully shot, and with a decent script the director could make a solid film but this certainly isn't it.","Jan 29, 2020"
5,"I watched because of the hype, but this is extremely overrated.","I watched this movie because of the hype around it, it's extremely overrated, it's a popular story Idea in the Egyptian film industry. This movie is to watch for once, never watch it again even after 10 years, never suggest it to anyone, very normal.","Jun 3, 2020"
5,This is not a good film!,"3 observations came to mind after watching this film:

When you have a film whose sole purpose appears to be to make some sort of metaphorical analogy of society, you will invariably find gaping holes in its plot, which the director will simply expect you to overlook.

There is no longer a ""safe"" outlet where one can find honest reviews of any sort, for any film, including forum sites, where people are supposed to share honest, unbiased opinions. And definitely not this site!

The goal of the army of ""recruited"" reviewers is to get you, the consumer, to watch the film. Period.","Aug 17, 2019"
5,"Meh, Ok","I've watched South Korean films most of my adult life. Films such as ""The Way Home"", ""The Handmaiden"", and ""Train to Busan"" are indeed great within their respective genres, and are testaments to South Korea's rising acclaim in world cinema. Parasite is not on the same level as the aforementioned titles. Instead it is quite typical of mediocre SK movies - choppy, childish at moments, and the dialogue isn't highly cerebral. It wasn't great nor was it bad. I'm not sure what all the hype was about with regards to it deserving of an Oscar for Best Picture either. I think people in the United States simply haven't seen enough SK movies to truly appreciate the breadth of cinematic entertainment that SK has to offer. Perhaps with Parasite, it must be the novelty of glorifying criminality in a very conservative society that's piqued critics' and American viewers' interests. Yet, this concept is nothing new in SK films.","Feb 23, 2020"
5,Um?,It was an OK movie. I don't understand how you can give an Oscar to a movie that's just kind of meh. I was hoping that the ending would be something super interesting or exciting but instead it was just kind of sad. I feel like to call this a masterpiece is an insult. It was a movie it happened and it was two hours long.,"May 2, 2020"
5,Am I the only one who didn't like the movie?,"Wow I can't believe the hype. Am I the only one who doesn't like this movie? Considering the awards and the hype I was expecting a master piece or something extremely interesting, entertaining, deep and with a plot twist. None of this happened. The movie is just okay, it didn't have a goal, it's just some random stuff happening just like that. Not to mention that none of the characters were likable and you can't create the bond, respectively you don't care about them. Most of the events looked fixed, unlike other korean movies where the realism was better and the tension was real. Until the end I was expecting some great twist, similar to the Cabin in the Woods for example, but no, it was just a massacre that was actually expected and it got executed poorly and in a naive way. I really just don't get it why is this hype, the movie is ok, sometimes difficult to watch because it's long and slow sometimes, kind of watchable, but definitely not a master piece, far from it. Very overrated in my opinion. The Awards were handed for political reasons I guess.","Oct 16, 2021"
5,bad,Very bad. The picture is overrated by critics. Does not contain a story. Only an aversion to the main characters.,"Jan 14, 2020"
5,Typical 3rd World Country Reality,"Not new. The feeling brought by the movie is so normal. Coming from a 3rd world country, this is understandably not a hype for me. I guess the strong impact made by this overhyped movie is applicable to to those 1st world countries only.","May 8, 2020"
5,Oscar contender???,"Well, I'm shocked by other people's perception that for some reason this is a great movie. It's okay...weird, strange, far-fetched, unusual, but not the best movie of 2020. Same goes for Jojo Rabbit.

I recently saw 1917 and it is by far superior and my favorite so far this year. Ford v Ferrari and Once Upon a Time in Hollywood were also quite good. Have not yet seen Joker, The Irishman, Little Women and Marriage Story, but will.","Feb 9, 2020"
5,Much hyped,"In the disguise of highlighting social inequality they just manage to show 2 extremes of society but in most cumbersome & blatant way. In fact the poor been shown as if to leach on the rich and live off (right from the title) no creativity or novelty in incidents or scenes. Characters are not at all introduced or given depth, everything is hurried throw. Climax is hotchpotch and forced upon. Much much over rated movie. Oscar ???","Dec 24, 2020"
5,"Masterpiece First Half, A TOTAL Letdown A Bit After That","A unique, compelling, perfectly acted, written and directed film almost to the very end. Really this story is so original and interestingly presented that I was amazed at how good cinema Asians can create.

Unfortunately though, the climax and epilogue of Parasite (2019) was a total letdown and almost ruined my entire experience.

I don't want to give anything away about what happens in the plot, so I'll be as discreet as possible. Watch it! Give it a chance. Maybe I'm being overly pretentious, but it seemed to me that the filmmakers were chasing some more epic and unexpected ending than the entire film was before that, and personally, everything that happens after the third quarter of the film is total insanity and nonsense.

Final score: 5/10.","Dec 13, 2023"
5,A masterpiece? Really?,"If it was only the 8.6 on IMDB I could say it's because of the accounts, or anyone can vote or something like that... But it has 6 Oscar nominees, won Palm d'Or, and hundreds of other awards and I really can't get HOW? It's an ordinary movie, I'll only remember it for how overrated it was.","Jan 16, 2020"
5,Overrated,"Sure, the concept is original but that's also the only thing this movie got going for itself. This is definitely not better than Joker. Joker is a masterpiece in every way and this is just alright. Why people love this movie so much is beyond me. It's not bad or anything but it's not nearly as good as people make it out to be. If you want a movie with an original scenario you'll want to check it out. But everything else about this movie is just alright. It's not mind blowing or anything, not at all. The music isn't fascinating, the acting is good but not Oscar worthy and the cinematography is just alright. Joker should've won the Oscar. Joker is amazing and this is not. This is mediocre at best. If you think this movie is better than Joker, you are delusional. I get that taste is subjective and all but literally everything about Joker is better than this mediocre piece of cinema.","Sep 13, 2024"
5,They went overboard,"Brilliant first half. The character building, the interpersonal relations, and the little scheme of the family was more than enough. Then, the second half they turn to over-the-top dramatics, plot twists and drizzle on some moral preaching at the end. The movie could have been just as great without it, simply because the casting, writing, and development in the first half was incredible.","Aug 26, 2022"
5,"Technically perfect, but the plot is weak","Went and saw the film in a theater after it was re-released because of the Oscar win. And....like many reviewers here, I am baffled as to why this movie garnered so many accolades from Cannes to Hollywood. It is brilliantly filmed and well acted, but when it comes to its script, I can think of many more efficient, more subtle, less simplistic movies tackling class warfare with the purpose of entertainment. Indeed, Italian comedies of the 1960s and 70s were masters in that field, and they did it with fearless gusto, caustic laughs, perverse subtlety -and no artificial twists like in Parasite. I can watch over and over ""Bread And Chocolate"" (1974, with Nino Mandredi) or any Ettore Scola movie of the same period (try ""Ugly, Dirty and Bad"", 1976, for great fun!). I don't think i will remember Parasite in 3 days.","Feb 21, 2020"
5,Overated,Very over rated. I watched this movie because of its good reviews. Wasn't as good as it was rated.,"Aug 15, 2021"
5,Don't believe the hype!,"Actually this movie is not that brilliant! It has a good start, but then the plot is just disappointing. The end ruins the whole movie. The occuring violence is a very simple move to finish the messed up plot.

And do not expect good acting or realistic characters. It is just overacting.","Mar 30, 2021"
5,Average,"Don't get all the fuss about this film, it is very average in every possible way. Started interesting but mid-way through it became boring and not compelling.","Jul 12, 2020"
5,It's not as brilliant as they want you to believe,"It's a good entertaining movie, but for me it was very predictable. For those who are not in touch with other cultures or poverty issue may find this movie very innovative, but it has long sequences that are very boring. But overall, if you are someone who watch movies regularly, you will find this very predictable. I wouldn't call it a ""masterpiece"".","Feb 11, 2021"
5,Confused by The High Ratings!,"I didn't see anything special about this movie. It wasn't unique, mind provoking, mind blowing or anything special. I feel I've seen several similar movies in the past. I think if you keep everything the same except for the language, setting and subtitles (American made) then this movie would have been just another, 'it was okay', movie.","Jun 14, 2020"
5,"A decent 5 Stars, certainly no 8.6","I think the movie is totally overhyped and definitely not worth the 8.6 score. In my opinion there's simply no way you'd score it with anything beyond 6 Stars, let alone prize it with 4 Oscars. Politics... again played a huge role in the Oscars SMH. Politicizing the nomination and the awards is disgusting. This must be stopped immediately.","May 15, 2020"
5,5*,Too much conspiracy.. for a low budget movie . And beacose it takes 2 hours you must have a lot of patience,"May 13, 2020"
5,It got Weird,"This movie started out wonderfully and had the potential to rival films such as ""Arsenic and Old Lace"".The first part of the movie was set up to deliver more satisfying plot twists. Unfortunately after developing the characters and plot it fell all over itself trying to make a statement on the rich and poor. my message to the writers and director, tell a story, make a point , and please entertain and enlighten us. Don't get weird.","Feb 11, 2020"
5,Too hyped up,"I liked only the first 30 minutes or so - the rest is just too... I don't know how to put it, well it's kind of boring most of the time. It's too hyped up. I don't agree with the portrayal of the classes - the rich guys are idiots (how did they become rich), the poor guys are smart and cunning (why are they poor then?) and then we get the ""big reveal moment"" in the movie and from then on it just dies out.

There's something not right with the film, I just can't put my finger on in. Intelectually speaking, the film discusses the classic societal and class problems. It's like the ""Malevich Square"", there will be a million different interpretations to it's meaning. I don't know if the director intended for it to be anything deep and to have many different layers - but anyone is free to make his own judgement.

I didn't like the ending, it's got the classical blood thirsty ending that so many asian movies have that it's almost cliche.

In the end I think it's overrated, this is a solid 5, it's watchable but that's it for me.","May 10, 2020"
5,It was just average and pretentious,"Visually it was amazing, a korean film with international appeal made it fun to see.. but thats it! I was expecting a deep dive psychological thriller and got confused along the way with the message it was trying to relay to the viewer... how can others say this was some deep discussion on class differences when the poor cant fold boxes, are con artists and liars, and the rich are a well off family that work hard and care for each other, whose only crime was having a bad smell problem... its not riveting, its weak. There were so many plotholes and missed opportunities. This film was extremely predictable yet offensive to whoever this film was intended for, rich or poor... who are you supposed to root for? Definitely not the poor con artists, and if thats done on purpose it shows a tremendous pretentiousness. Its an average well done movie, receiving high praise because it was korean made... ive seen better in the last 10 years. By all means, watch it though.","May 7, 2020"

5,great,Amazing show. Keep it up this way My fav decades are my past decades.,"Apr 25, 2020"
5,Go in open minded....,"So I went in after seeing 10/10s, 5 stars and Oscars/ awards.

You know how a celebrity starts a trend and ten years later no one can believe that was fashionable and it actually was horrendous.

I get that vibe here, because the film is so unique and Let's the viewer decipher the plot, people are saying this is great because it's thought provoking, similar to a tate modern peice of art, red splash of paint worth 5 million because the artist is famous.

Anyway, as you can tell I'm not that keen on the film but didn't hate it, just left confused to the over inflated ratings, reviews and awards. Go in sceptical and you may far better than me.","Apr 11, 2021"

5,Bong Joon Ho is Ki Woo,"Despite its social commentary and clever cinematography, this movie is still kinda cliche, with predictable and forced plots, with cringeworthy acting here and there.

BTW, Bong Joon Ho = Ki Woo, Hollywood = Park family.","Apr 13, 2020"
5,It was really hard to watch this mishmash of a movie.,"The movie just doesn't seem to know what genre it is. If you step onto a boat, it doesn't suddenly turn into a submarine or a bus, but this movie does. It starts out so improbable that it's funny, then gets mean, vicious, violent, tragic and depressing. Others have said that it's an allegory about the class differences between the haves and have-nots. My eyeballs roll at this. So what! Life isn't fair. That is no excuse for one-dimensional characters. A family of grifters that is too stupid to succeed at anything somehow manages to cleverly con its way into the lives of a wealthy family. Of course, this must end somehow or there'd be no tension. You know something is going to eventually happen as the unexpected fortune of the poor family cannot continue, but why does it have to end in such gratuitous violence? What kind of person likes watching that? It makes you feel guilty about laughing during the comedic sections earlier in the movie.","Sep 3, 2021"
5,Why did this get an Oscar?,"Now this isn't a bad movie, not at all. Just so overhyped, which kinda ruined it with me. I feel like people like this just because it's so politically right, like what happened with black panther. Just because it's something you believe in doesn't mean it's good. I felt like it was way too long. And how did this get an Oscar over 1917, which is obviously superior especially in the visual category. I just don't understand why so many people like this mediocre film.","Nov 3, 2020"
5,Evil and shameless,What does this movie want to tell us? That the people living at the bottom have a tough life? That these people are evil and shameless? That they are continue to be like this as if THEY are the heroes? I can't believe this movie won 4 Oscars!,"Apr 3, 2020"
5,"Not that deep, severely overrated","There are a few suspenseful scenes and a decent plot, along with comedic dialogue, but that's it. It's not a ""metaphorical masterpiece"" that some critics and users are saying. I feel as though too many people are trying to be expert critics like on that episode of South Park where the entire town writes crazy yelp reviews for all the restaurants.","Feb 27, 2020"
5,Unexpected,"Uhmmmmm... Not expecting the events turn into such madness. Sad, but it will teach you a lot of lesson.","Apr 19, 2020"
5,It's amazing what marketing could do.,"This movie is so over hyped. I WANTED to love this movie. But as soon as I saw the Palm D'Or logo at the beginning of the movie I knew they were telling me I was supposed to like it and find it intellectual. I didn't. Still don't. The dialogue was bad. The story was meh and none of the tension came from between characters. The most tense movie came from when they were hiding under the table in a will they or won't they be found. Honestly, the same scene played out in Jurassic Park but with the dinosaurs vs the humans. I actually like Jurassic Park more.","Feb 16, 2020"
5,Am I the only one who thought this movie was lackluster?,I thought character development was great and pacing. That's about it. A ten year old could figure out the plot twist. I just don't get it. But in all fairness I hated Midsommar more.,"Feb 12, 2020"
5,This movie got a Oscar?,"Was it a good movie, meh. Was it a bad movie? No, but certainly not a Oscar worthy movie if you ask me. Te first 30 minutes of the movie are really good, but after the 30 minutes it starts to become a awkward movie with a strange twist. I do like a good twist in a movie but this became just to strange that it didn't make any sense anymore.","Feb 13, 2020"
5,Overhyped like those Kpop shows,"Really overhyped and overrated. The movie is OK but far from ""best of the decade"" to be honest. When watching the movie I felt that I was always 2 or 3 seconds ahead of the plot, which (especially the first half) vibes like that of a cliche sitcom show, squeezed and polished (really hard) into an ""artsy"" crowd-pleasing movie. This whole unprecedented praise around the movie, which I guess I will never understand, somehow reminds me of the fanatics about Kpop, which, (un)surprisingly, shares the initial ""K"".","Feb 10, 2020"
5,Seriously?,Give me a break! That should be a film which deserves 4 Oscar's? Heavy handed directing and foreseeable script! Sorry don't get the hype! Only good thing: the film makes you uncomfortable!,"Mar 23, 2021"
5,Whers the beef?,I watched this movie because it won so many awards last year. About 1.5 hours in i got up and started playing on my computer... this movie wasted 2 hours of my life. Its nothing special and i think there are way better movies out there.,"Mar 30, 2020"
5,Much hyp for a fun movie at most,"The movie was kind of original on the history, but feels pretty slow. I cant understand the hype, maybe the exotics of the culture and the neccesity of the academy to achieve more diversity. No such a great movie as other said.","Feb 19, 2020"
5,I didn't like it so much,"I might be the only one who didn't really like this movie. I went to the cinema to watch it with high expactations, and went out with disappointment. The movie is not bad, but also not good. I think it's overrated. Some things are not connected well and what in the high point of the movie happens doesn't satisfy me. In the cinema, I was literally like: ohh when will everything explose, the action should start soon. At the end of the movie, everything blows up, but it's not how you expected it. I cannot explain why I don't like it but something was not so right in the movie (not about the topic, about the course of events)","Jun 29, 2020"
5,I guess I just don't get it,"One Sunday night I eagerly watched the oscars, hoping my favorite movie of the year once upon a time... in hollywood would win several awards. While it won a few I was shocked to see parasite win so many. A few weeks later I decided to rent the movie and watch. And after 2 hours I can say that I don't think it's all that great. Let's start with the positives. I enjoyed the comedy. There were several bits that had me laughing. They were probably not in the same spots others would usually laugh but nevertheless I thought the movie was decently funny. I thought the acting was pretty good too. Both sides of the family pulled off a pretty believable take on the rich and the poor. But that's all I can really say I liked about the movie. About halfway into the movie I turned to the person I was watching it with and told them that ""This movie must get pretty great within the next 45 minutes amiright"" I had heard so much about the many twists and turns of the movie and I can say that they're really wasn't ever a big twist for me. I mean there was one. That one lead to the entire 3rd act of the movie so I can't really say it was all too surprising. As a person who has loved Movies since I was a mere lad I can say this wasn't anything too groundbreaking, and can definitely say if it was made the same exact way expect by an American, the movie would be perceived as sucky and unoriginal. I really tried to enjoy this movie but I just couldn't. Maybe someday I'll revisit it and see something in it.","Mar 2, 2020"
5,Dont believe the hype,"Highly overrated. I was really excited about that film. Now i am disappointed and wondering why people are so blown away by it. Its okay to watch on a sunday afternoon, but not more at all. I get that there is an underlying critical depiction of the korean two-class-society (that i as a middle class western can not really understand) but the storyline seems to far fetched and the behaviour and dialogue of the protagonists are not convincingly crafted. Maybe again, its the korean style, but nonetheless it wasnt convincing. Actually i waited for it to end.","Mar 8, 2020"
5,Way overrated,"10 main characters, all paper-thin in their description, none of which appealing. Story is stretched beyond credibility, for a story meant to provide ""social commentary"". But well filmed, and the house looks nice, for sure!","Mar 12, 2021"
5,Decent movie...but 8.6? Out of 10? No way.,"If people are really this starved for quality movies, I am not surprised what with the second-rate retreads Hollywood is doing lately.

However, the actors are all surprisingly likeable despite the content and actions. You feel for them and their situation, but at the same time, I feel the director portrays wealthy people in a very unfair light. It really is the immoral ones who are impacting others' lives with their actions, not the wealthy family.

Overall this is worth a watch, but it is not worth 8.6 stars. Ridiculous.","Jan 23, 2020"

5,Am I missing something?,"I was so looking forward to Parasite. What a disappointment. Is this the movie that has won all these awards and put Korea on the map? I sat through it waiting for something to spark my interest, anything that would raise this oriental potboiler social comedy of manners into high art. It failed to materialise. The acting is cartoony (perhaps it's supposed to be), the plot downright silly although I would say it had some originality and overall it just seemed pretty poor. It was neither satirically funny enough or dramatic enough to be a stunning black comedy. Far too aware of itself. I did want to like this. I was anticipating another ""Roma"" but all I got was a frantic mess.","Mar 15, 2020"
5,Not a masterpiece...,I liked the house and the cinematography. Struggled to watch it. Didn't really warm to any of the characters. Laughed twice. Plot was predictable but not a crime in itself. Wouldn't recommend.,"Jun 26, 2021"
5,It is really really overrated and so-so movie,"I am a fan of Korean movies. Most Korean movies are good. This one is not an exception as to story line and actors. Comparing with the great hits like Along with the God and Train to Busan, this one is less active. What surprised me is that this mediocre get more rating than those great films. Actually, the whole movie is done in a house. I don't know why a lot of people overrate this movie.","Jul 28, 2019"
5,Not so great,"Movie was recommended by friend, who lauded it how many rewards it had gotten, so we watched this with high expectations. Despite the movie calling itself comedy there were only a few places in between that were relatively funny. And therein lies the problem, the movie was undecided which genre it wants to be, drama, comedy, horror, action? The story depends on plot twists to keep it going, some are predictable some are unexpected, and some are outright stupid. I'm talking about the finale, it just looks out of nowhere and forced so the viewers don't end up with a lackluster ending. It's a bizarre flick, but in no way great. I'd give it a slightly higher rating but there's a need for counter-balance to all the reviews overrating this movie.","Jul 11, 2020"
5,"Sure it's pretty, but do I care","Nope. I care nothing about these characters nothing. This is something happening in a lot of current film and television, the inability for me to care about the good or the bad characters. All these people's story are for me just average. I've seen these stories told before.

The movie needed editing. Could have easily been 1.5 hours. The end seemed drawn out and rushed all at the same time.

The camera work and color is beautiful. That's about it. Best picture...please give me a break.","Sep 5, 2021"
5,Question mark,"Not sure why this movie score so high in rating. Been seeing korea drama many years, just a drama plus a movie call (US) version. No one in my cinema was laughing its lame joke,I prefer the US way of telling the lower class try to overtake upper-class story.","Aug 18, 2019"
5,eccentric - not for everyone,"Like many korean movies - this is flush with good actors and great visuals - but the story is twisted - at least there is a certain amount of sanity from the wealthy family - strangely enuf - while the desperately poor family at the heart of the film - are so depraved that i thought they deserved their station in life

the first half of the film showed this miserable family displaying such skill and intelligence and adaptability - that it didn't seem possible they were the same people seen at the start of the film

i quickly got bored waiting for the axe to fall - and their plans to go awry - but it took many dreary minutes for it to happen

the second half was action filled - and tense - and chalk full of unexpected moments - if the story had moved more quickly to this part - i wouldn't be so down on the film

but it didn't - it's 2 hrs 12 minutes - much of it in the accompaniment of unpleasant people - who don't all get what they deserved.","Oct 24, 2021"
5,Why all the fuss,"I often go to the movie but never write any reviews. Given all the fuss around this one, I felt the need to make an exception: this is so overrated. Do not get me wrong, it's not bad: camera work is good, story is not boring and acting is ok for the most parts (with the possible exception of the girl trying to act drunk on the sofa - think Japanese drama). But describing this as the film of the decade? I guess you need to be pretty illiterate in movies.","Feb 12, 2020"
4,Good Story with a Pathetic Climax,"Story revolves around a Family which goes to an extent of earning money that they accept all types of crimes like fraud, cheating, culpable homicide and even Murder. Message is pretty clear - Parasite (It's Harmful) Movie is good till it hits the climax.","May 18, 2020"
4,Normal movie,Just wondering why it's highly rated. The story is weak and it's another ordinary story. Maybe because it's Korean. I believe the Founder movie is away better.,"Mar 3, 2020"
4,Oscar worthy?,Over hyped nonsense. Too long and I didn't care what happened to characters. Needed to be a short film and im being generous. Although i thought the 3 dogs were better actors.,"Apr 19, 2020"
4,Maybe expectations killed it for me?,"Sure, its well shot, crafty in its production. I like the original story, but I am not sure if it is as much of a great movie as it is ""meant"" to be. It's a good watch, but I find it to be far fetch in the negligence of some of its characters and relies on stupidity in their favors.","Sep 29, 2020"
4,A potentially great film with one MAJOR flaw.,"I don't want to bash this film - it had a lot of very good qualities: Nice cinematography, well edited, good sound design, good art direction and decent acting. I'll go as far as to say the story was a very good premise and had incredible potential. BUT: No story is complete without good character development, and this is where this film fails CATASTROPHICALLY.

Here it is in a nutshell: WHO CARES?! Besides the imposter family (protagonists) being of low economic status, the writers make almost no effort to make this family likeable in any way shape or form. They are all pretty much detestable scumbags right out of the gate. There is ZERO conflict of interest or moral dilemmas as the family goes about their con games - you know, the kind of writing that would normally draw the audience in and generate sympathy for the protagonists as they make their poor and ultimately tragic decisions.

In any good tragic tale, the audience should feel conflicted in their emotions when the protagonists meet their ultimate fate, but this film achieves none of that, at least in my opinion. I was literally rooting for their downfall through the whole film. Honestly, how do you screw that up?! It's classic 101 storytelling.

Honestly, if you feel sorry for this family in any form during this film, you're probably a sociopath - and the fact that this film is held in such great regard is very concerning.","Mar 7, 2021"
4,Extremely overrated,"You have seen the ludicrous reviews claiming that this is the best film of the year and that it will be remembered for years. It won't. It's a nonsensical movie about a bunch of weirdos. It's well shot, but if you expect a movie to give you some positive feelings, some lesson, or an inspiration, well prepare to leave the movie theater empty-handed.","Jan 26, 2020"
4,Disappointed,I had high hopes for this due to the Oscar awards but was left rather disappointed. It was an odd mix of comedy and serious drama with unconvincing characters and a bit of a stupid story at times. Very different but for me fell flat and very overhyped. I've watched much better thought provoking films with good social commentary.,"Jan 13, 2021"
4,I've seen much better comedies,"When I watched this film, I'll admit, perhaps my mouth twinged at the corners a few times (more so than most other films declaring themselves to be ""comedy"" which I rate one star on average). But this film is mere tripe, it pales in comparison to the refinement, depth and complexity of the popular Adult Swim show, ""Richard and Mortimer"" (Rick and Morty for lower IQ individuals). In fact, the part in particular that has utterly taken my fancy is an episode wherein the titular ""Richard"" transforms himself into none other than a lacto-fermented cucumber, and proudly proclaims his new designation to be ""Pickle Rick""! Oh how I laughed, for this is true comedy, this is art. This film simply fails to compare to its better, and while I consider it above average as far as modern comedic films go, I simply cannot rate it higher than 4 stars. This is probably due to my incredibly high IQ. My name is Jeurel Barton, bury me with dislikes if you disagree","Mar 2, 2021"
4,Overrated movie.,Sometimes I really believe people are high when them watch specific kind of movies in festivals.,"Nov 28, 2019"
4,A movie made by a 'far away' country doesn't make it a masterpiece,"We live in a time where liking the eccentricities born from different cultures with a sprinkling of foreign language makes something supposedly good.

However, the moral from Hans Christian Andersen's story 'The Emperors New Clothes', is: telling ourselves something is 'good' doesn't mean it is; and, that is very much the case for Parasite.

In the main, the film isn't too bad. A poor family move in on a wealthy family and it eventually leads to tragedy. The acting is only 'alright' but certainly not fantastic as many reviewers say, and the viewer doesn't learn much about the wealthy family. The film also leaves many unanswered questions, such as:
It's all a little silly really

The film will appeal to:
1. Wave the flag of support for anything foreign 2. Think being 'politically correct' is a political party 3. Think transgender-ism is choice not a biological state

If you haven't seen this, you're not missing much.","Nov 9, 2020"
4,Mostly boring,"The first half hour is promising. Then it turns into a catastrophe. No one can believe, even with simpletons as employers, that anyone could have hired the father and the mother who've been unemployed for so long, obviously because they're good to nothing. They're irresponsible heartless. The movie is overlong and mostly boring, the characters are unlikable. And it all ends in a screwball comedy which becomes a ridiculous gore horror movie. The screenplay is contemptible and I wonder what parts of the movie were so well directed that the director can claim having been influenced by Martin Scorsese. If I were Scorsese I'd resent it as an insult.","Feb 14, 2020"
4,Made to look easy many facts missed.,"Over hyped. How can successful people be shown so dumb that they won't even bother to validate facts.

Quite a sily movie over hyped. Not worth","May 17, 2020"
4,"Still wondering ,why this got 4 oscars","I wanted really to liked it ,but I couldn't. I liked only the last scene ,but I could not like any of the characters. I don't know if that was the purpose ,but for me at least one character has to be likeable. And all the poor-rich thing has been told better from soap operas.","Feb 29, 2020"
4,Nothing Extraordinary,"I'm not really sure why this film is so incredibly well regarded? I feel like it was hyped up heavily pre-Oscars based on momentum / buzz, but the end product has me confused because there's absolutely nothing ground breaking here. Was it the fact that it was filmed in South Korea? Maybe people are so used to the K-pop fluff garbage coming from SK that when something of actual artistic substance is produced via their pop culture it gets blown out of proportion, when compared to their usual fare. Let me say now, Parasite is in no way a bad movie. It has something to say, the plot is decent, and it is well shot. But the plot line and story itself isn't really saying anything new or different that hasn't been done via Hollywood in the past. I also felt like some of the performances weren't A+ material, probably why the film wasn't nominated for any actual acting awards. The main male child and dad did good enough work, the daughter and mom, and the members of the ""rich"" family? Not so much. Basically throwaway performances. Again, not a ""bad"" film, but if you are looking for a revolutionary vision and message, keep looking.","Feb 14, 2020"
4,"Excessive force, not all",It's not interesting. The director's excessive force has some emotions that cannot be expressed.,"Jan 29, 2020"
4,What's the big deal,"I must be odd man out. I saw the humor the gore the deceit the regrets, just didn't add up for me. Just weird","Feb 14, 2020"
4,"Mediocre, at best","I'm unsure as to why the film has been overrated. The main theme of the film is status, class and betrayal. However, I think the film fails to make these themes compelling and thought-provoking enough to motivate the audience to care about the characters. The first half is extremely uninteresting and it is difficult to not be sickened by the actions of the family, despite their poor economic background.

There is some intrigue at the second half but to be honest I found the overall structure of the film's plot to be too chaotic and convoluted. compelling enough. As a result, there is something missing from the film. The events that occur within the film are quite surreal and hokey. Some are the scenes are downright bizarre and made you wonder why the character said that in such a melodramatic, unrealistic way. This affects the believability in what you're seeing, thus negatively affecting any sense of connection with the characters.

Forgettable.","Feb 11, 2020"
4,Dumbfounded by all of the praise heaped on this film,I am absolutely baffled as to the reason why this film has received such praise. Best movie of the decade? Best Picture of the year? Uhmmm no way no how. The movie was perfectly fine. I'd go so far as to say it was an average movie... perfectly fine. Certainly not a film I would watch ever again though. 1917 was amazing in my opinion and should've easily walked away with Best Picture.,"Mar 1, 2020"
4,Overrated and boring,"This movie has one excellent idea and one clever twist. Cinematography was great and the overall setting ambitious. Yet, it seems quite overrated. Attempted allegory about capitalism is rather obvious. The movie lacks true emotions and feels forced. There is no character development or subtle interactions between characters. I felt disconnected with the main characters which made the movie boring despite the plot-driven concept.","Feb 24, 2020"
4,Average,"So to me, the movie was really average. It failed to really grab my attention and keep me on the edge of my seat. The story was also really predictable. I'm not saying it was bad, but it just didn't appeal to me as other movies of this genre. In my country we come across these types of scenarios all the time about the less fortunate families and what they have to do to survive etc so maybe to me the story wasn't so out of the ordinary and I've seen worse on the news. I understand it was really deep and metaphorical, but it just failed to resonate.","Feb 20, 2020"
4,COPYCAT - HIGHLY OVERRATED,"This is VERY HIGHLY OVERRATED. just don't understand what makes this movie so special that it has been appraised so highly. It is not even 10% of the Tamil movies at this level/standard. People who're praising this movie must start watching Tamil movies instead of Korean, there are so many gems that have gone unnoticed. There is really nothing special in this movie that stands out. Cannot digest that an average movie like this has got so much limelight. Btw: Where does this trend start off?","Jan 12, 2020"
4,"Sensational, for the wrong reasons.","If this was the best picture of 2020, then it doesn't say much for the rest.

It starts off ok, a comedy, but slips into a darker shade of comedy. After about an hour it is getting well into black comedy and the last 20 minutes it becomes a slasher movie.

I don't think I have ever watched a film when I have wanted to stop watching with 10 minutes to go.

Very unrewarding.","Dec 16, 2021"
4,Quite bad acting and unlikely plot.,Incredible that this movie can get such high ratings. Will not recommend watching it. Completely unlikely plot and quite bad acting.,"Feb 6, 2021"
4,My goodnes...,"4 oscars? 4? For what? This is what you get when you falsly sue real movie makers and let amateurs work. I'm shocked seeing thos mediocre movie gets such praise. Did we truly lost our minds? This just shows how political everything got. 4 oscars for this? This is average B production movie. It is not comoplete garbage, but 4 oscars. You lost your mind.","Feb 14, 2020"
4,It's uuuh... long... And VERY overhyped.,"So I'm curious - this won awards with all of its plot holes and terrible ending? Can't decide what tone it wants to have, can't conclude a story, instead doing the most open-ended ending in the history of endings... Starts mini plots about people getting into a relationship that you'd think will lead to something, but instead just leaves it all hanging, and thus leaving me hanging after watching it for over two hours? And frustrated... And this won awards and is so overhyped?

Let's back up.

The concept is nice and simple - ""Parasite"" doesn't stand for yet another zombie movie, but rather a social parasite - a bunch of manipulative poor people slink their way into working for a rich family and eventually even living in their house.

It's a decent comedy, fairly original, but it's just... soooo... loooong.... Over 2 hours that feel like 5, and a lot of it is just boring talk that should've been cut. Because if that was done - this would've been a great comedy. Not ""ha ha!"" funny, but still quirky and weird enough to bring a smile to someone's face.

But it's long, not that funny, not that well written (borders on kid show-style comedy), and since it also doesn't have a single likeable character, I can't say I loved it.

I know idiots will write about ""metaphors"" and what not, even though this movie is basically beating you across the face with what it's about - there's no metaphors - don't expect anything too deep. Or deep at all.

The ending was pretty predictable, and shall we say -- NOT GOOD AT ALL, so yeah... I didn't really get much laughs out of this, it wasn't very interesting, and it ended in a way that made me feel like I really wasted my time there.","Dec 4, 2022"
4,Maddeningly bad film,"Should have known when it got the academy award for best picture it would be disappointing. I really enjoyed Bong Joon-ho's Memories of a Murder and Mother. Unfortunately in this movie there was no character development and the characters were just stereotyped cliches. The less fortunate family was just a pack of sociopathic dirt bags and the well off family was laughable with its disinterested father, pretentious and anxious mother, the spoiled son who runs riot pretending to be a Native American as he preys on the house maid with his bow and arrow set, and finally the moody, withdrawn awkward daughter. The only character with any spark is the previous housemaid. The story plods along in predictable fashion with an ending without redemption or closure for any of these pathetic souls. For an academy award winner there were so many silly and unbelievable scenes where things magically disappeared from one scene to the next. Most notably, how the hell did the son in the less fortunate family get that rock back after his misfortune? See the movie and you'll see how ridiculous that is. The Morse code nonsense was tied together poorly and with little purpose. Movie ran out of steam at the end with nothing happening to leave the audience satisfied or even thinking about what just happened.","Feb 14, 2020"
4,Failed portrait of the Poor,"The Rich. And the Poor. In this one the poor family is neither fighting for their rights nor are they fighting for their future. They try to go along as the parasites of a rich family. I guess, this script shows perfectly, how a saturated generation X sees the stereotype of poor people in today's times. Nothing to like in this movie. The story is inhuman in every sense.","Dec 25, 2019"
4,4 Stars for the first part only,"Maybe i miss something but i wonder if there's a character you that represents a positive emotion or sympathy. All characters were parasites (and still you can't see a ""cow""! Well, if you think that Almodovar meets Stephen King in Korea that's ok. i want to know, if any one believes this is the best movie ever would he of she will watch the film for a second time? Well, me no! Better from the Old boy? No! Funny? No! So 4 stars only for gasp of classes.-","Mar 31, 2020"
4,How on earth did this win Best Picture Oscar?,"I am sorry but this movie is garbage, and anyone who is convincing themselves otherwise really needs to give their head a shake. This is like a 1960's Carry On film, but just with present day styling, but when brilliant movies such as City of God cannot even get to the short list of Best Foreign Picture you have to wonder why the Academy saw fit to elevate this to its top award ..... basically its not fit too lace the boots of COG, and is certainly not a patch on Joker or 1917. I know that movie opinion is very subjective, buut surely I cannot be the only avid moviegoer who feels like this.","Feb 11, 2020"
4,Astonishingly.... meh.,"Watched with high expectations, based largely on almost exclusively gushing reviews. It was... ok. To me, nothing special. Perhaps it contains a kernel of greatness which I'm unequipped to get at. In which case it can go and rammit. I'm definitely hearing 'green needle' where the majority (at least of those who have voiced their opinion) are getting 'brainstorm'. While I'm here I'll recommend a Korean film that WAS deserving of its acclaim, Oldboy. See it, or see it again (it rewards repeat viewings). Oldboy is film you can easily fall in love with and sets a benchmark for fantastic cinema - Parasite doesn't come remotely close.","Jun 8, 2020"
4,Waste of my time,"This movie is full of plot holes, especially on the second half. The supposed twist is full of stupidity and the ending can not be worst than that. Really dont understand how can this win the Oscar.","Apr 17, 2020"
4,Social satire retread. Nothing new.,"Social satire retread that brought nothing new to the topic. It seems to have brought the topic back to the basics and to the beginning again, and that leaves me feeling as if we haven't learned anything. Maybe that is the ultimate point: class warfare is neverending. Heavy handed storytelling with moments of what I'm assuming are to be ""nuggets of wisdom"" giving insight to motivations in the class struggle. This has been done better and done with more thoughtfulness.","Apr 26, 2020"
4,"This is what passes for art these days...overrated, too slow","It surprises me how critics have a taste for movies that may be artistic but are just awful or average experiences at best to watch. If you're a film critic you might like this movie for the reasons that all the other film critics do.

If you're an average moviegoer who wants a movie with characters to relate to and a story to inspire and remember you would be disappointed.

The first half of the movie is way too long in setting up the premise, you don't realize what the movie turns out to be until the second half making me feel like the first half consisted of too many irrelevant details and was way too long. By the time the movie picks up pace you're already tired. I found myself skipping every thirty seconds towards the end.

Secondly, a great movie should leave you with a positive feeling, either a feeling of hope or inspiration or if neither of those are possible atleast the satisfaction of having had a good laugh. This movie does none of that, it leaves you with a feeling of despair and hopelessness. Sadly that is what passes for art these days.

There were some good parts about the movie, such as the acting was top-notch especially from the sister. Cinematography was good too but the movie was just not deserving enough to be the best picture of the year.

If it wasn't so highly rated I would've given it a 6/10 but giving it a 4 to bring the rating down to what it should get.","Mar 7, 2020"
4,Not for me,"Lots of high scoring reviews on here and the 8.5 average made me give it a go.

I'm not knocking anyone who scored it either high or low but I didn't like it and found it a bit boring in the middle. As for messages I couldn't pick up any message beyond. 'Don't cook the goose that laid the golden egg'","Mar 27, 2022"
4,Just OK for me,"After a first screening in a theatre, I couldn't understand the hype around PARASITE. So I watched it a second time at home and once again wasn't impressed at all. I suppose it's just not my kind of flick, and as I write this review a few months later, I realize that I don't remember much of it, even after seeing it twice. I have read all the praising comments with a 10/10 note, but couldn't find any of the qualities described, as if people commented another movie.","Apr 4, 2020"
4,Way tooooo overrated!,"Quite original,but thats all... the Academy made a weird choice this year..a bit disappointed.","Feb 10, 2020"
4,what a waste,"Simply for me its the worst movie of Bong Joon ho. Plot has a multiple and serious goofs and all the screenplay seems to be a pretension for the director/writer to express all of his ideas about injustice and cruelty of modern Korea and of course the world. In order to do that in good cinematic manner, a writer should first write a good screenplay that the plot twists come from the characters and believable situations and then the director visualizes it in his point of view to accomplish his ideas, something we saw in great Ken Loach movie, ""I, Daniel Blake"".I exampled this movie because it has same theme about injustice. Of course Bong Joon ho is a great writer/director and i love ""Memories of Murder"",""Mother"" and ""Snowpiercer"", but after seeing this movie i was disappointed,as simple as that!","Oct 15, 2019"
4,"The accolades "":Parasite"" has received is testimony to the aesthetic blindness of our culture today.","One movie I definitely recommend you DO NOT see is ""Parasite."" For the first hour it is a clever and engaging black comedy, with pointed social satire, but it gradually morphs into an over the top slasher movie. It was like Tarantino and the Cohen brothers took over the set in the second half-- or they may have turned the plot development over to a team of adolescent skin-heads. The fact that ""Parasite"" has received so many accolades is testimony to the state of aesthetic blindness of our culture today.","Feb 6, 2020"
4,Why the adulation?,"To beat Scorsese,Mendes,Tarantino and Philips AND to beat The Irishman,Once upon a time...,1917, et al - I really was expecting this to be something special. I saw it with an afternoon audience who were mostly in their ""twilight"" years and the majority of comments at the end expressed puzzlement that this was the best picture of 2019. Lack of laughter during the performance implied that the film missed its' mark as a comedy. Perhaps its' role as a satirical social commentary of the gulf between the poor and the rich in South Korea might have been hitting targets but surely that would only be appreciated by a minority audience.

Personally, I felt that Ho had been given a box set of Ealing comedies made by the likes of Alexander Mackendrick, Charles Crichton, Robert Hamer and Henry Cornelius and simply transferred the tone to a South Korean environment. Of course the influence of Hollywood's ""wild man"", Quentin Tarantino,had to appear in order to appeal to a modern audience and of course it is there in the second half. I can only imagine that nowadays, the voters at Cannes and the Academy are made up of people too young to remember films such as ""Kind Hearts and Coronets"",""Whisky Galore"",""The Lavender Hill Mob"" and ""Hue and Cry"". Otherwise they would have realised that what is being exhibited is not ""new"" and different but is a retread of old classics.

I've watched ho's ""The Host"" and ""Snowpiercer"" and can't help but feel that he has potential but is not the maestro some,usually sensible, film critics claim. For one thing he needs to tighten up the pace of his storylines and keep to a central theme without going off at a tangent. There is also a whiff of patronisation here which implies that everyone in the ""industry"" were surprised that a South Korean could come up with a global hit. The moneymen are surely thinking that this is not a breakout hit for Ho but a breakin hit into a lucrative South East Asian market. Would it be the same hit if it had not been awarded ""Best Picture""? I doubt it very much.","Feb 11, 2020"
4,This movie isn't for me.,"I'm torn on how to rate this. The acting was good, the cinematography was pretty amazing, and I was captivated by the plot, but I just really didn't like the story.

Most of the characters seem like terrible people. At first they were fine, dude was taking a job. All good, he helped his sister get a job by lying. Eh, fine whatever. Then getting other people fired to take their jobs... and then it all ends in murder? I'm not confused by the plot, but rather confused about why people love this so much. Granted, it's probably just not my thing. I tend to not like movies where most of the characters are terrible people and there's basically no redeeming qualities. Classics that people love, ""Gone with The Wind"" and ""Grease"", are two movies I hate. This movie did nothing for me, other than leaving me confused on it's point. If you loved it, that's fine. I'm not trying to hate on this movie, or people who like it, I just don't get the hype.

After watching a video explaining the themes a bit more, I decided to add two more stars to my rating. I understand the themes and why they are important, but this movie isn't for me.","May 22, 2020"

90 minutes would have done it for me....make that 45 minutes. Way too much hype for a theatrical mess. Maybe best foreign film but best movie of the year, ha.

Social topics covered here didnt really touch me at all. I didnt feel bad for the poor nor for Parks family. Didnt even think about the movie after it was done, whilst i thought about every other oscar rewarded movie for a long time after watching. Anyways, its probably me, who enjoys development of characters and atmospfere in the movie and none of that can be found in Parasite.","Jul 9, 2020"
4,Only interesting,"Interesting movie and perhaps better if you are Korean speaking. However, can't believe this movie was an Academy award winner?! I can think of at least ten other 2019 movies that were way way better. You may want to suffer your way through this movie just to see how irrelevant and misleading an Academy award winning movie has become to the general movie goer.","May 29, 2020"
4,Trying to save people's time,"This movie just wasted over two hours of my precious life. I would rather stick cacti in my eyes than re-watch this horrible film. It had an interesting beginning but in the middle of the movie it made me realize that it was going nowhere. On top of that, the ending was just stupid. If you value your life, you won't waste time on this movie.","May 12, 2020"
4,Overrated,"In my opinion this movie is overrated. Because of the rating i watched this movie but there is not good as rating. One i like from this movie is description between rich and poor. I like this part a lot, that's why this movie got an oscar. But overall is not good as rating.","Jun 3, 2020"
4,That's it?,"I love Japanese films but this one is so OVERRATED. I raised my expectations so high but didn't get what I envisioned from it. I don't know where all the hype is coming from, I'm sorry.","Apr 6, 2020"
4,Overrated film,"Overrated film, a naive and commonplace view of the modern life with absence of deepening and with scenes just to impress us, but from a technical view have a mastery of skill.","Mar 17, 2020"
4,not so good,"I loke the movie, but i hated the actors.. and i don't think this movie deserves the Oscars","Mar 9, 2020"
4,More interesting than okja,But defintely didn't deserve the best movie award. That should've went to jojo rabbit. There's so many things wrong with this movie. It starts out interesting and then just collapses into things that don't make any sense.,"Feb 28, 2020"
4,Hugely overrated movie.,"I wouldn't recommend the movie to literally noone.

It was simply a 4 in my books, a 5 at most, but definitely not 7 or 8 IMDB points type of movie.","Mar 2, 2020"
4,Extremely average movie,"When comparing and competing against other movies on a world wide scale, it falls quite short. Stereotypical and to be honest I'm getting sick of movies coming out of Asia that portray the upper class in the exact same style. The story never captured me throughout the whole movie. Sorry but other foreign movies this year deserved the awards.","Apr 18, 2020"
4,Overrated movie,"Nothing really happens in this movie, the first 1 hour and 50 minutes nothing happens, then a very medicore thing happens, and that's it.","Aug 11, 2020"
4,Average but not as good as ratings says otherwise,I am still trying to figure out why would such meaningless movie get such a high ratings. There are thousands of films better than this but end up getting petty reviews.,"Apr 2, 2020"
4,Dismal dark comedy,"After this movie bagged the most coveted oscar,I finally decided to watch this movie. The first hour went well with the tight plot and realistic situations and performance by the characters but somehow it lost its grip in the second half and characters strangely appeared overdoing. Finally the climax of the movie totally turned out to be a big disappointment. I would have preferred 1917 or Ford vs Ferrari to win the accolades. Even Joker or once upon a time in Hollywood would have been a better choice.","Feb 10, 2020"
4,Sooooooo Overrated,"I'm sorry but this movie is garbage, and anyone who is convincing themselves otherwise really needs to give their head a shake. This is like a 1960's Carry On film, but just with present day styling, but when brilliant movies such as City of God cannot even get to the short list of Best Foreign Picture you have to wonder why the Academy saw fit to elevate this to its top award ..... basically its not fit too lace the boots of COG, and is certainly not a patch on Joker or 1917. I know that movie opinion is very subjective, buut surely I cannot be the only avid moviegoer who feels like this.","May 22, 2020"
4,Not bad,"I am really confused by people who call this film ""groundbreaking or a ""masterpiece"". It's a watchable film that takes a while to gain momentum but manages to keep your attention. Nothing earth- shattering or innovative about it. A good experience but I would not pay $14.99 again. I fell victim to the hype.","Jan 22, 2020"
4,Not seeing the appeal.,"If you like to watch movies for escapism and finding entertainment and optimism then don't watch this. I can't say it's poorly made, acted, or written, but I couldn't relate or care about anyone in the movie or anything that was going on.","May 12, 2020"
4,What happened to the general taste....,"Im still figuring out why the viewers are making a big deal of this movie? Just to be fair the oscars award granted for the movie are deserved and all credits goes to directing and screen play otherwise everything was pretty much expectable and crystal clear , plot twists are meh and the whole movie was a slow burn, really it's not that much well scripted.","Mar 4, 2020"
4,I clearly don't follow the trend !!,"I often watch Korean movies, and they do have a style that is proper to them. I really appreciate what the Korean artists try out with the cinematographic art. This movie has created a lot of hype in the industry ... even got an Oscar ; by watching the cover and the title, i didn't want to watch this movie. But then it got recommended by a very close friend of mine (who's working in Korean affairs). I gave it a shot ... and ... i was right ; ... i didn't like this movie. To me, i didn't find the ""humour"" amusing (although quite a lot of Korean movies are really good with humour). The story itself was pathetic (however that is the point with a title like ""Parasite""). The end (which for me started at the point they were getting hammered) was overly long and messy. All that being said though, the actors are really good ; the screenplay is most times well done (although too many close ups) ; but frankly ... it is overhyped. I think this movie responds more to those being bourgeois.","Mar 22, 2020"
4,90 mins of yawn,Just like a daytime soap opera for 90 mins then a drama for last 30mins! I want to be entertained for the whole movie ! Big yawn,"Aug 11, 2019"
4,Really not great,"Just like with Snowpiercer and Okja when I think back on this movie I am forgetting it faster than I can remember. There are just too many different Genre's happening here to really give anything any sort of devoted attention.

Aside from that my, oh my, how predictable. 15 minutes into the movie I knew what the first hour was gonna be about, and I was not wrong. The second act got slightly less predictable but only because it was really trying to not.

It could have been much much better had the finale come up with a more interesting solution.","Aug 19, 2019"
4,A film without a heart,"Two families exploit each other with dire consequences. Beautifully shot and well acted, but devoid of emotional engagement. Little comedy, horror or tension and at no point did I care about anybody involved - which amounts to a wasted trip to the cinema, in my book. Very disappointing, given that it beat some truly exceptional films to the Oscar.","Feb 22, 2020"
4,"Well, let us just say....","... that his movie was not for me. But i can see how this is my problem and not the problem of the movie. I love immersion and the movie did nothing to immerse me in any way.

But who am I to judge? I don't know anything about cinema, I only watch movies for entertainment. And this was just not entertaining for me.","Jun 28, 2020"
3,For The Concept Only,"Have you ever wondered why certain movies receive an Oscar for Best Picture?

It's political. The weirder, more topical and more virtue signaling that goes on, the more a film will capture the actors and directors who vote for Oscar candidates.

This movie was seen by less than 1.5% of the US citizenry.

Take a look at the cast and ask yourself what else you've seen them in. It's Korean based so likely either nothing, or maybe one other film.

Additionally, in this day and age of jaded critics, if something is strange and unusual, well, that'll get press. Didn't mean it's good.

It'll be interesting to see if this film stands the test of time.

Frankly, I highly doubt it.","Jan 13, 2025"
3,it's a NO from me,"I liked the first half a little bit and i was hoping the second half will deliver , and nope it's like when you try to cook something nice you get everything ready and start cooking then it comes out bad and you throw it to the trash like this movie exactly 2 hours i will not get back !","Jul 9, 2021"
3,Not so good,"The movie has a very nice direction throughout, it however gives a wrong message to society. The Park family was not doing any wrong to kim family , they have earned money by their hardwork and luck. The kim family did all wrong means to enter the house and slowly slowly they became careless of their responsibility. Mr Park and his wife were decent people, but the movie did not talk about it, rather it tries to justify the murder of Mr Park by Kim family.","Mar 25, 2020"
3,"Objectively as possible, it was super boring","I was excited to finally see this movie with all the rave reviews, awards and hype behind it but man, it was so boring that I found it difficult to make it through to the end.

The main reason for me is because there was no character development. More specifically, there was nothing in any of the characters that made me care about them so the whole movie is just things happening and nothing at stake from a viewer's perspective.

Nothing that happens is particularly shocking or twisted either- I might even say that it's fairly predictable. Going back to my main point, didn't care for any of the events that happened.

Even if I didn't know about the hype beforehand I can objectively say it was just a boring movie. For me anyway.","Mar 17, 2023"
3,"Help yourself, don't watch this movie","Boring movie, the acting is fine but there are too many unnecessary scenes and the plot is bland, uninteresting . A waste of time","Jun 30, 2019"
3,What a waste of time,"I agree with the reviewers who did NOT rate this as a 10. Incredible waste of 2 hours plus watching it. I don't even know why I gave it a 3 as I found nothing in it that really was of interest. How the Academy could give this Best Picture is beyond me. Ok I see it could get Best Foreign Film but NOT Best Picture. 1917 was a much better and well made film. If I wanted to listen to the babble of dialogue in this I just have to step onto the street of any major city or town.

Another thing that gets me fumed these days is why credits are so small they can hardly be read. Even the title PARASITE is so small it cannot be read on. TV screen at least. And when will Producers realise RED CREDITS (not in this film) can never be read when shown on TV.

I know I will be condemn by many reviewers on here but we all have a choice in what we want to watch. Actually I quite enjoyed this Director's SNOWPIERCER.","May 1, 2020"
3,"Shocked that this is called a ""masterpiece"" and almost perfect rating.","3-Star for the amazing house and some of the cinematography, but nothing compares to the cinematography of some of the other epic films. The other 7-star for a film that's makes Dumb and Dumber and Mr Bean masterpieces.","Jan 20, 2020"
3,I'm shocked,"If this film has won 4 Oscar awards then it means that the world of the big screen is changing, because it is a nice film but it is not a masterpiece that everyone is showing, films like scarface, last tango in paris, once upon a time the west did not win an oscar and this film won four gentlemen i am shocked","May 7, 2020"
3,Overrated,This movie is good but it's a bit overrated. There are more better movies than this to watch,"Jul 24, 2020"
3,Oscar joke,"The Emperors new clothes, that sums up the reaction to this movie. This movie is the modern day ""Slumdog Millionaire"". One of the strangest Oscar decisions ever. It's not a bad movie by any stretch, but a masterpiece? LOLOLOLOL, no - not at all. The acting is average, there is little character development that is compelling, the script is boring, zero humor. At no point does this movie grip you and beg you to keep watching to learn where it goes. Years from now like ""Slumdog"" we will look back, especially at the cinematography and laugh at how great we thought this was.","Feb 15, 2020"
3,"Decent for the first half, decends and fizzles from there","The fact that there are such a ridiculous number of 10/10 reviews proves most of them are not genuine. Who cares about the ""clever"" metaphors when a movie just fizzles out into an absurd and unbelievable nonsense conclusion.","Feb 9, 2020"
3,Absolutely nothing! This is below average and for sure not for an Oscar!,"Bad plot. Bad accting. Shallow. Overrated. Amazed by the stupidity. Score is paid or here is some brainwashed people who give it more than 3 stars for this mediocre movie! Genre, what genre?! Overall not worth it!!!","Jan 22, 2021"
3,Heavy on Style Lacking in Substance,"Once again the Academy Awards get it wrong. Awards for film are meaningless and superficial. I've never been a fan of the art house genre. However, I do appreciate the films of David Lynch, and I believe he's the only one that has turned art house into a fine art form. I bet five dollars that the six hour long sequel to this film never sees the light of day at HBO. It's too soon after the disaster that was GoT. Parasite was too slick and packaged for mainstream consumption. Much like the human branding it so desperately tried to spotlight. I could think of a hundred foreign films the Academy passed over for Best Picture for some American made drivel. This film was not one of them. Down with all awards shows!","Feb 18, 2020"
3,Another flaw,"If the guys sense of smell is so fine tuned ( panties in the car), why can't he smell the food and drink stuffed under his couch 1 foot away from him?","Mar 17, 2021"
3,Over hyped guilt trip,"Exaggerated acting ( which even in Korean standards were terrible ) , really long unnecessary guilt trip to poverty. Most of the viewers will bored before the second half and the ones that say they loved the movie are just afraid to be labelled as ignorant or racist. I am not saying this is a terrible movie , but before declaring this one as One of the greatest in Asian cinema , try watching several Asian movies . There is nothing new or nothing eye opening about this movie. It is just another marvel of marketing. Anyway I will not suggest this one to anybody. Go watch les-miserables if you wish to watch a guilt trip movie with a style and quality.","Jul 8, 2020"
3,Drags its feet,"I was really looking forward to seeing this movie. Reading the synopsis itty sound good.

I had to stop watching with 35 minutes left in the movie.

I was incredibly bored. I enjoy slow movies but this was.... I felt my life being wasted.

Go watch Annihilation. I saw that recently, that is a good movie.","Nov 12, 2019"
3,WTF did I just watch?,"I'll keep this short and sweet. What an overhyped pile of garbage. It had its moments, but after it was all said and done it was just a long Three's Company episode with a twist ending that was uninspired.","Apr 20, 2020"
3,where's the redemption?,"Well made movie but i suspect there are a lot of phony reviews posted here to gain an Oscar win. I liked the acting and story line. However there needs to be some redemption (despite the political statement of classism). Cruelty can be a means to develop a plot into something more transcendent. I didn't grasp any of that, just a descent into hell. Too much over the top sensationalism.","Feb 9, 2020"
3,Extremely weak overrated movie,"Obviously overrated plain movie about social cheating. Surprisingly, the movie was well-received by Korean fans...","Jul 21, 2019"
3,Primitive,"I'm really amazed under which category this film lies. Comedy? It is not funny at all. Tragedy ? I don't know!!! Four Oscars and Palm d'or !!!! Are you serious. I can't say that I know better than the people who awarded the film these prizes, I'm sure the problem is me, there is something hidden deep in this movie I couldn't see.","Jun 22, 2020"
3,What was that?!,"The only good thing about this movie is...

Nothing.","Apr 21, 2020"
3,Sad to see comments and awards,"The movie is bad quality, and seeing people trying to feel good about their social sensibility upon a garbage like this is to see how lost people are nowadays.","Mar 14, 2020"
3,ok for it's type and the country it came from,"Since Hollywood is hosting the Oscars , they have different categories ; ie such as foreign film. Now that is the field this should have been in , and only that. Since The Oscar is intended for the USA not the world. Hollywood needs to rethink giving away the farm. Case in point Slumdog Millionaire , stole the Oscar from Benjamin Button likely because of a sense of pity. As for this film , it was ok , not spectacular , subtitles were annoying. Likely won't be seen much, due to lack of interest.","Feb 15, 2020"
3,Definitely more than over rated and not comedy at all.,A true master piece is in which one cannot pin point the the mistake of the situation. Here they get into the family by lie so thats it. The bubble already busted as if anything goes South it's Thier fault. U can't expect someone to be good even when u are wrong. The story is ok little twist n bla bla but killin the rich is not justify in any case...,"Apr 3, 2020"
3,A Titanic achievement,"Richly appointed, a glitterati champagne Cannes launch to an inebriated fanfare of stratospheric expectation, then unexpectedly in mid-journey an iceberg crash, an unsettling sinking feeling, followed by an agonizingly slow cascade into drowning horror. Compared to another mediocre superhero movie it might rank favourably, but a far cry from Tati or Hitchcock. Closer to a stylish 70s exploitation film.","Dec 28, 2019"
3,I don't get it.,"A much sterner test of whether or not I am going to like a film than the word of mouth from film aficionados on Reddit or when it is ""certified rotten"" is how quickly it goes to 40% off at Barnes and Noble. This did so pretty quickly my, against my better judgment I decided to use up my gift card proceeds on this turkey. (Mainly because it is more and more difficult to find a Barnes & Noble that sells DVD's.) This had the potential to have been a very pleasant diversion, reminiscent of the American screwball comedies of the 30's and 40's, when it decided to go over the top and embrace every genre but comedy (and Westerns.) The film concerns two Korean families, the haves and the have-nots The haves are composed of computer exec dad and his faux sophisticated wife and their two children, the teenage daughter, studying English to achieve success on college entrance exams and a junior whiz-kid artist whose works are obviously normal scribbling. In the course of her studies the daughter has the services of a college student who has decided to take a sabbatical and recommends his friend, a non-college educated but English fluent son of the have-nots as his replacement. The son quickly sizes up his new employers and sees room on the job for sis as a art therapy expert who would be just the person to expose junior's genius to the world. Eventually the entire have-not family become ""parasites"" feeding from the prosperous haves. All vestiges of any comedy then disappear and philosophy seems to take its place. It is not a welcome change. Watch it at your own risk considering the source of all enthusiastic comments that might tend to sway you.","Mar 5, 2023"
3,Waste of 2:12 mins,This movie won best picture and this proves best picture winners are often times terrible like this movie. Its not funny and is extremely slow and pointless. The last 40 mins is completely different than the first part of the movie. This movie may have been a 5 if it was not for subtitles.,"Dec 14, 2020"
3,Didn't deserve 1 Oscar,"I gave initially 7 stars, but I changed it to 4. Why? It's not close to get even 1 Oscar. 7 stars was for a little sympathy for the Korean films. But getting undeserved 5 Oscar's has let me lose all the sympathy for this film. A Bollywood kind ending was terrible enough. The social message of the film has also big problems which bothered me during watching it. A low class family manipulate a rich family to infiltrate, taking advantage of them, lying and cheating, doing harm to other poor people, letting lose their jobs, is not a way to show a way to get attention to the class differences. I'm very disappointed in the Academy Awards. There has been many good foreigner films in last decade and non has won any decent prize.","Feb 11, 2020"
3,Overhyped,Not worth the oscar material. Not a must watch. A normal film. Highly overrated.,"Mar 29, 2020"
3,Waaaaaaay overrated,"I must have seen a totally different movie, because I almost fell asleep in the theatre. And I really wanted to see this movie. It's just a prefect example of how social media and a decently filled marketing purse make you go watch movies you'd otherwise ignore. I really like Korean flicks, but this was whether fish nor flesh.","Oct 30, 2019"
3,Why? How? I can't understand,"I hate this movie. There is no story. What is the point? How this movie got an Oscar? Am I that stupid that I can't understand the ""art"" behind this movie? So many questions.","Mar 22, 2020"
3,Quentin Tarantino - The South Korean way,"I watched this movie during the 3 days, with pauses. It exhausted me really. Such a pain in the ***. It is nothing more than a pale copy of Tarantino's movies, with a plot so unrealistic and boring. The acting was awful too. The only decent things about this movie was a solid camera and photography, as well as the scenography. I really cannot understand all the fuss, the hype and Oscars won.","Feb 21, 2020"
3,Reading subtitles just doesn't work for me.,I was really excited to watch this movie. When I started watching I was very disappointed that there were subtitles. It's hard for me to really view The characters and action While trying to read subtitles. Hopefully one day It will be dubbed in English. I know that my take a way from the movie for many but it makes a lot easier for me to enjoy it even if the lips aren't synced perfectly to the words. If they can sync English to old movies like Godzilla and Mothra they can certainly sync English to this movie.,"Feb 11, 2020"
3,The most over rated movie I know,Mother in 2009 is one of my all time favorite movies. This movie was weak with a terrible & predictable ending. It only won an Oscar the downward slide of Hollywoods unoriginality,"Feb 11, 2020"
3,Not as good as they say it is.,"I think the hype that they created for this movie was what caused me to build my expectations when I started watching the movie and I was kind of waiting for something to happen that would blow my mind, as the story progresses. But that moment never came... It just seemed to be just an ordinary movie and does not deserve the hype. The movie is completely overrated... watch it for yourself and tell me I am wrong. There was another reviewer who gave a low rating that said ""did we watch the same movie?"". That's exactly the feeling I got after watching the movie.

Rating wise it's probably not a 3 but a 5 or 6 at best but I am so disappointed after watching the movie that I couldn't resist scoring it low.","Feb 15, 2020"
3,"A statement on society: not the film, but by the response it evokes","I came here because the high ratings were bothering me. This feels like one of those films by a director that has grand ideas but actually very little experience in the real world (that leads to what can only be described as pretentious outcomes). Now by ""experience of the real world"" I don't mean that the films premise needed to be more grounded, far from it, some of the most outlandish unbelievable (heck even total fantasy) stories can feel grounded thanks their attention to detail that make them (or their world) believable. I mean here that the details/this world is so unbelievable that the whole experience is boring/an insult.

This manifests itself most prominently in the character's and their development.

There are collections of character traits bundled and attached to two main groups of characters: poor and rich. Presumably this is to make the overall plot work (the poor are conniving and greedy and the rich are... well rich? And apparently dumb with their lack of curiosity and poor decision making). This falls apart almost immediately when the poorer family show signs of being sloppy (they can't be bothered to fold the pizza boxes properly and do not understand what's wrong when there is complaint) yet have meticulous attention to detail (they perform an A-class service to the richer family on demand?). Both seemingly motivated by their want for money. If they were indeed driven by money via attention to detail, they would have had a million opportunities in-between these extremes. This inconsistency leads me to view this as a poor treatment of the ""poor person"" stereotype and much less than being a statement on society this film is actually an embarrassing statement on the directors ignorance.

This is forgivable, not all directors have had the world experience and who is to stop them from making a film? It looks nice at least. What is not forgivable is that the Oscars can't see this for what it is (nor the endless reviewers). The pretentiousness therefore is mirrored in the critics praise - they think they understand a clever observation on society, but all they are revealing is their own poor understanding of class and how people work. Forgivable again perhaps for the average viewer, but critics with large audiences? There's your statement on society: people with loud voices haven't got a ******* clue.","Dec 29, 2021"

Both seemingly motivated by their want for money. If they were indeed driven by money via attention to detail, they would have had a million opportunities in-between these extremes.

If we are to feel anything for this family, they need to hold some values we can warm to. The suggestion that they are hard-working well-meaning individuals simply down on their luck is once again rendered unbelievable when they take the nasty decision to harm the original house made of the house. There is no dog-eat-dog need to do this, again if they used the smarts on display within this household outside of this household, they would inevitably be more successful and have less need to do this. Yet it is this utterly flawed down-on-luck narrative that upholds the social commentary of ""unfair class divides"" that apparently makes this film amazing.

The treatment of the rich is also highly flawed. If they are (as many critics have read from this) representations of greed and ignorance, why is the mother then only one that seems to be treating people kindly and fairly? If this is a commentary on how people behave - it is the mother and father of the rich family that are the kindest and fairest and how are we to feel badly towards them or their situation?

There should be some kind of Korean Film Maffia or IMDB Trolls who voted with high score.

A complete nonsense.

3,I have sleep apnea,"This movie was so boring. So overrated. I admit it - this is not my genre - but even so I do not see why this movie was almost universally critically acclaimed. One good thing about watching this movie - I fell asleep and apparently have sleep apnea so I'm gonna go get that checked and treated. So, there's that. If you like interminable movies with an absurd plot and no movement, then this movie is great. Me personally? I'd rather have a colonoscopy than sit through this movie again.","Jan 26, 2020"
3,Poorly written and Overrated !!!,"I am from India. After watching this movie, I started to wonder whether the jury team was qualified enough to judge a movie. So pathetic...

I watched this movie only in 2024. For a long time, I wanted to see this movie since it had won many awards. Today I got a chance to watch this one. Below average and poorly written. Not convincing at all. I started to wonder how this won awards.

What's the main theme of this movie? Social inequality and class differences... that's fine... I am not against this one. It's a global one. The issue needs to be addressed in many countries. But the story and screenplay were so poorly done.

In India, we too have many social inequality issues in our society. Many films had highlighted those issues in a very convincing way.

Especially, the climax scenes (the garden party scene) are so poorly written in this movie. Poorly written and overrated!!!","Dec 25, 2024"

3,Completely overrated Korean drama cliche,"I read the synopsis couple times before but it did not impress me despite the rating. Finally, I ignored my bias and have just watched it and I don't understand why such a cliche and unrealistic movie could get 8.5! Someone might say it is metaphorical or a lesson is conveyed. I don't see any merit in it. Acting is good, that is all. Logic is terrible, ethical implications are vague at best (leaning toward anti-ethical), social justice or meritocracy messages are completely mislead and unrealistic, and the ending is just a fantasy... Korean movies are way too dramatic. While they exaggerate the drama too much, they miss logical connections and meanings, and you lose connection with the characters. This movie deserves 6/10 but I am giving 3 because of overrating and a huge disappointment...","Aug 20, 2024"
3,For those who like farce,"I don't care much for farce. Farce is a story where all the plot tension comes from a pretense. A quarter of the way into this, it's clear we're in the land of farce. Halfway in, we're bored and restless and merely waiting for the pretense to be caught out.

The cinematography is nice. The acting is competent. The struggle of class against class is forever relevant. But it's still farce.","Feb 23, 2020"
3,Stretching its limits,"Parasite, directed by Bong Joon-ho, is a critically acclaimed South Korean film that has received numerous awards and accolades. However, in my opinion, the film falls short of its hype. While the premise of a lower-class family infiltrating a wealthy household is intriguing, the execution is heavy-handed and lacks subtlety.

The characters are one-dimensional and lack depth, with the lower-class family being portrayed as cunning and deceitful, and the wealthy family as naive and ignorant. The film's attempts at social commentary feel forced and preachy, with the message of class struggle being hammered home repeatedly.

Furthermore, the film's pacing is slow and uneven, with long stretches of exposition and character development that feel drawn out and unnecessary. The final act, while shocking, is also predictable and lacks emotional impact due to the lack of investment in the characters.

Overall, Parasite is a film that is overhyped and overrated. While it may appeal to those who enjoy heavy-handed social commentary, those looking for a more nuanced and subtle exploration of class struggle will be disappointed. Despite its critical acclaim, I found Parasite to be a disappointing and forgettable film.","Mar 31, 2023"
3,"Overrated, very predictable for the most part","The hype around this film is staggering. As the film unfolded, I predicted all but two of the things that happened. It just seemed like such an obvious stream of events other than the surprise half way through and the Tarantino -Lite ending.

There's an almost complete lack of sympathy for, or empathy in, almost all of the selfish, unpleasant characters. Maybe that's the point, but if you want a film where there's someone to root for, this isn't for you.

Although you can see the point the film makes writ large from an early stage, it does a poor job of making you think the downtrodden deserve any sympathy.","Feb 26, 2023"
3,Boring and too complicated,"This is honestly a not-so-good-film. The storytelling is awful and i really dont get the story.

A movie which fails with the most basic thing as storytelling isnt good.

I've really had higher expectations, based on its Palme d'or winning, which i really don't think it deserved to win.

Acting is pretty good, but not anything over the usual.

Editing and filming is however a bit better, but it dosent get my rating up, because the awfully complicated storytelling and the story developming.

Manuscript is very bad and pretty boring.

To summarise this is a boring an dtoo complicated film.

I usually enjoy those films which you cant get sometimes, like ""Asteroid City"" (2023), but this movie fails totally with captivating my interest in it.

Wouldn't recommend at all.","Jul 14, 2023"
3,The movie is clearly overrated.,"I agree with many who wrote above: it is completely unclear who eventually parasitizes in the film. Absolutely all of his characters work, regardless of social class, and the fact that the main characters received jobs in a rich house somewhat fraudulently can be found almost at every step, there was nothing particularly shocking.

If the main rich man of the film were the personification of all the nasty things that the bourgeoisie can associate with, then it would be much more powerful. That is, if, for example, he beat his wife, mistreated children and a maid, went to the left, threw tantrums for no reason, then one could still understand the wave of indignation of the father of a poor family, indignation that reached its climax in the finale. But this is NOTHING. We see a peaceful family, a caring father and mother who love children and really do everything they can for them.

From here follows the conclusion from the opposite: if the main rich people of the film are decent people, a loving family, then I would like to see the embittered, humiliated and offended poor people, which would play on this contrast. But this is NOTHING. Both of them love each other, everyone loves children, there is plenty of respect between family members, there is simply NO contrast, an antagonist in the film.

In general, I do not understand why such films receive Palme d'Or. There is a much more poignant movie, underestimated by critics, not getting anything. There are many such films. And here for what, well, for what? For timing? For a beautiful picture or a good game of actors? This is now easy to do if you try a little. But the fact that the main thing in the film is very false - the PLOT, this cannot be corrected by anything.","Jan 19, 2022"
3,Dark. Bleak. Pessimistic. Wasted Opportunity.,"It starts off somewhat light-hearted. It then shows how people act inauthentically to fulfill certain role expectations, and to manipulate people in order to be accepted (and paid). It explores the hypocrisy of prejudice and how people slip into an 'us and them' mentality. It alludes to how people feed off each other.

It had potential to then provide some sort of moral undertones - to provide some sort of remedy; perhaps through the characters having realisations that lead them to make positive changes. Perhaps even leading them to humility, redemption or reconciliation.

But it pretty much just veers off into a horror movie. It tries to be clever with allusions and metaphors about unconscious and repressed psychological forces. And perhaps there is some allegory for the North/South Korea divide in there as well. But the story becomes so over the top in its efforts to disturb, that it loses credibility.

If you want to wallow in pseudo-intellectual generalisations about socio-economic class conflict and long outmoded Freudian theories of psychological neuroses, then this might be a movie for you.

Verdict: Dark. Bleak. Pessimistic. Wasted Opportunity.

3/10.","Nov 7, 2023"
3,Not what I expected,"I don't know how to describe what I watched. Mixed feelings. Starts good but as the plot goes by it totally changes. There are not the known ""bad ""and ""good"" characters. Everyone in this movie act for his own good trying to protect his family. A totally allegorical movie with some weird morals.

Sorry but I wouldn't like to watch this movie again.","Jul 5, 2021"
3,A positive bias,"...seems to be surrounding many things South-Korean and Japanese, at least that is my feeling. The culture and art of these and other Asian countries get hyped ferociously in the west. I am not saying that I mind, people can like whatever they want and there is so much intriguing and nice to like but it does have this unpleasant side effect that films like this are treated like pure gold. This film is not, for me.

I heard much about this film, read many great reviews it being incredibly funny, frightening, disturbing, dramatic and and and. A Film that should have won all prices as best competitor in all genres(a part from adult and children's movies). So I watched it expecting it to be dark, smart and deep and at the same time entertain me and make me laugh, and cry at best. But it did not. I yawned quite a few times though. It is really long and it would probably be so much more entertaining if it was just 90 minutes but as it is several scenes just drag along not giving the viewer anything no content, no grand acting, no new and brutal visuals(yes, the scenery IS VERY WELL DONE! But it is not so beautiful that I want to stare at it while nothing is happening and also after a while we have seen all the shots so thank you, next.) And about all the genres...it really is not that funny, not that dark, not frightening and not horrific, some drama in it but not done better then in many TV shows in all fairness. I might be unable to understand some of the humour as I do not speak Korean and also I could only find a synchronised version so there could have been some puns that just flew over my head but I doubt that that would have made a change.

The acting is not great, the characters are not really likeable and sometimes feel unfinished the story does really not make much sense and the twists and turns are not something incredibly smart or unexpected. I must really say I went in hoping for great entertainment and did not finish it in one sitting but stopped half way in and finished it the next day because I was disappointed and bored and felt like using my time differently.

It is simply a film, the message is very simple and while it has some nice shots it is really not a film I would recommend....to anyone really. I even now knowing the film, rereading the reviews do not see what those people saw in it. Which is grand! People have different tastes! As a review in simple terms: A mediocre film, with nothing outstanding about it and ruined by a too long running time which results in the film being boring.","Jul 19, 2021"
3,Nothing really that Special,"The film's social message is extremely cliché and repetitive. We are tired of seeing so many films like this. The director shows no creativity in choosing the subject matter. The film lacks cohesion and fails to establish a solid foundation for the events that are supposed to unfold later.

The elements used to depict poverty are overly exaggerated and repulsive.

The wealthy family appears excessively naive and foolish, making them unrealistic.

However, despite these flaws, the director does present some good visual techniques to convey the themes in his mind, and the actors' performances are average.","Aug 18, 2024"
3,Movie without head and leg,"I don't know why this movie got Oscar, seriously movie has incomplete story and weak story. Director didn't use the concept properly and sone parts of movie ar still mystery. Very poor direction.

Thriller part come at Last and it's also not interesting. This movie can be good if they use concept properly with proper direction. In starting face it's story is very predictable. I don't know why Oscar selector choose this movie. This movie is not eligible for nominations. I literally don't have trust on Oscar after this movie. Can't believe that it's IMDb rating is 8.6. Weak story and poor direction can't win Oscar.","Oct 12, 2022"
3,8 star rating for this?,"I have watched some Korean movies, part of which I genuinely liked, but this one...how this gets an eight star rating is beyond me. I have to admit, that those have been some of the longest two hours, that I have spent in a movie Theater. The movie is neither funny (it might be the dubbing, but I have maybe chuckled twice during the whole movie), nor shocking (unless You haven't seen movies before), it was filled with exclusively unlikeable characters, it was absolutely predictive, drawn out way too long and ultimately was just one big boredom. Yes, it covered different genres, but other movies did the same, just much better.","Oct 18, 2019"
3,Disgusting movie,"The movie does not establish humanistic values, depicting disgusting human sins. The Korean entourage makes it even more repulsive. I'm not sure why such a poor movie received so many high praises.","Jul 4, 2020"
3,The most overrated film of the last decade,"Parasite was an ok movie, it didn´t deserved the Oscar for Best Picture, a soap opera or a k-drama is better than this movie, what a disappointing.","May 15, 2020"
3,I am one of the few considering this movie over rated,"The movie itself starts fine. The pace is interesting and such, until that... It basically doesn't has too much to offer. It has some suspense and some insane plot twists, but that's basically it and I don't understand all the hype revolving this film.","Apr 23, 2020"
3,Highly overrated,It's a shame that this movie won so many awards over much better movies like 1917. This movie was terrible. Filled with unlikeable characters doing horrible things to others. It actually made me angry that this movie got so much critical acclaim. Very disappointed.,"Apr 13, 2020"
3,One of the Most Overrated Movies of All Time,"This movie is one of the most overrated/overhyped of all time. ""Deep clever multi-layered metaphors and nuances""? Sure, like a pretentious piece of modern art. Guess social commentary plus neat cinematography appeals like a valley girl that reads comic books.","Apr 8, 2020"
3,Overrated!,"I have no idea why people are so hyped about this movie. Poor family was shown as people who doesn't have any values/character, greedy and ready to do whatever it takes even to the people who are nice to them or the ones who are struggling as them. I found it wrong completely.","Mar 16, 2020"
3,super unpleasant and creepy,"Yes, this movie is well-filmed and well-acted. yes, if you have the time and interest, you can speculate about what the movie might mean as an allegory. i'm sure the theory and politics of the movie are admirable. BUT... 90% of the film is simply unpleasant to watch. none of the major characters is likable - much less heroic; no one succeeds or even grows. every character is amoral. one small example out of dozens: a young man going overseas to college gifts our penniless protagonist a job tutoring a wealthy 15-year-old girl in return for the promise to keep her away from dating til the student returns from overseas and the girl turns 18. our hero without a moment of hesitation betrays his friend and starts a romance with his student. i read that ""get out"" originally ended with the hero dying, that jordan peele added the rescue after preliminary focus groups said they hated the movie. parasite feels to me a horror movie like ""get out"" without the redemptive ending. or think ""inglorious basterds"" without the redemptive ending.","Jan 12, 2020"
3,Review,"Did not like The movie, and did not understand why it was on The Oscars Crap.","Feb 13, 2020"
3,fu*ked up,"This is the most fu*ked up movie I have seen in a long time. I thought the idea was exciting and the beginning was a bit of fun. But it got more and more crazy, I felt sick in the end. just wanted it to end. But I understand why some would like it.","Jan 31, 2020"
3,You have to know this before you watch this move,"I watched it because of the excellent reviews. It starts as an interesting and creative film, but be aware that it turns out to be a very violent and depressing movie. I really don't understand why some people call it a ""masterpiece"". Yes it is creative and thought provoking, but if you finish watching it with a very bad feeling, then in my opinion it doesn't worth watching at all.","Jan 19, 2020"
3,Not for me,I really didn't like it it just wasn't a good movie for me others may enjoy it but it's not for me. Great cinematography though,"Feb 13, 2020"
3,The square root of ten,"I walked out near the end of the movie. I highly recommend you don't spend time and money on it It made me very uncomfortable watching two hours of people scamming other people (and worse) for personal gain. Yes, you see that in movies all the time, but this one simmered in cruelty in slow motion...surrounded by beautiful people and sets. I didn't like ANY of the characters in the movie and that is hard to do I felt a hollow sadness when I left Maybe because it had a lot of ""10's"" or maybe it is a reflection of what society thinks is a good film. The only redeeming quality I saw was that the Korean people are sweeter than us , like 1950's bad guys in suits.","Nov 8, 2019"
3,Poor direction,"Soo so poor direction and Soo many mistakes in this movie , I don't how this movie got an Oscar it's really disappointing.","Feb 22, 2020"
3,Surprisingly shallow,"Gorgeous, memorable, and even startling cinematography, but surprisingly underdeveloped as the ""deep"" character and class study it pretends to be. Depressing nihilism. Director/writer clearly has given up all hope of modern civilization ever rising above the swamps of despair and manipulation. That's his right to an opinion, of course, but in this particular film his vision feels simplistic and seems to exist for no other reason than to provoke and wallow.","Feb 1, 2020"
3,Expected More,"The film won four Academy Awards and received praise from so many critics, it had to great right. With its thinly disguised story line about class warfare, it's no wonder Hollywood embraced it. I watched it all the way through and when it was over I felt nothing. Didn't love it, didn't hate it and frankly as Im writing this, I really don't remember much about it","Jun 4, 2020"
3,A boring movie.....,"I cant understand why this movie, won the oscar. A boring film with nothing interest. A hysterical plot and a naive scenario...","Feb 15, 2020"
3,Overrated,"Overrated, don't see what people are seeing in this movie to rate it with a 10","Jan 30, 2021"
3,Over rated !,"Really thats movie winning 4 oscars ! Sure u r kidding with me .. Not good at all , the only good thing in this movie was music , any thing else not.. There is no story in this . Not happy for seeing this .","Mar 24, 2020"
3,Timeless comedy,More than just a foreign language film. A true depiction of how far dependency can take a poor household. Bold humour at its best,"May 13, 2020"
3,Awful,"Really, one of the worst, most drawn out films I've ever seen. The people touting it as a 10 are pseudo-intellectuals trying to construct something that just wasn't there - like the amateur critics on here who think of themselves as legit film critics. I'm sorry, the film just doesn't deserve the hype or accolades, and most certainly not the Academy Award (even for foreign language film, let alone Best Film).

I was expecting something deeply profound and artistic, and this just wasn't either of those things. This is a horrible example of trying to expand one's cinematic palate to foreign films, because there are wonderful foreign films out there. I'm guessing the people that liked this also thought ""Mother"" was some sort of mind blowing masterpiece.","Apr 17, 2020"
2,What a pathetic drama.,Maybe people get too emotional in West. May be that is why it got an Oscar. There's nothing special about this movie; the story so average.,"Apr 3, 2020"
2,Wastages for teenager,This movie is only good for old & mature people .it not for young generation 😜😂 Waste of night for me,"Mar 27, 2020"
2,No thanks,"Decent acting, not great. Not suspenseful. Not thrilling. Not scary, not even a bit. Decent overall message. Parts seemed overly forced. Too predictable. Only finished watching hoping it would improve, but it did not. Would have enjoyed it more had it been 35 minutes long. 2 stars for effort and production. The high ratings are suspicious and puzzling.","Feb 20, 2020"
2,Just terrible,I so wanted to love this given the reviews I have heard but I was left wondering what film other people had seen. Idea was good but it was a nothing story in the end. So disappointed. Found the subtitles too small. Just could not have cared less. Why all the hype?,"Nov 7, 2020"
2,Dont Beleive The Hype,"The first half of the movie is very good and then the movies takes a Cohe Brothersesque turn to the absurd. As with the Cohns Adaptation and some others (and I'm a major fan of the CB), when the writers ran into the brick wall not knowing where the story should go, they turned to the absurd and contrived the rest to the intelligent consumers utter disappointment. This movie will not last the test of time and its user rating will fade lower in time. Worth the watch just to learn how to finish a screenplay thats amazing but has yet for formulate a working ending... Just contrive the absurd and youll win an academy award.","May 5, 2022"
2,Bored,I really don't understand how this has such high ratings. I really tried to like it but fell asleep less than halfway through.,"Nov 10, 2020"
2,Overrated,"Underlining that every taste is different. I just have to say that my experience was too boring, there were even non-sense moments. Like every bad movie.","Jan 20, 2020"
2,Don't like it at all,II don't like the characters. It doesn't move me. It's cold but not cold in a good way. I don't know what the message is. Just becuase it's an unfair class society you can act like an ***hole? The ending is silly. The characters revolting. It's an empty film an dthe rave reviwes are foolish.,"Jan 12, 2022"
2,Can't fathom the love for this movie,"Don't get the love people have for this movie. It starts as predictable slapstick comedy, then takes a sudden turn into a bloodsport parable on class warfare, and then then finishes -- can you guess? -- Nihilistic irony! Oh, that is really original, isn't it? All of the characters are unlikable, one-dimensional, amoral, lemmings. Apparently, Korean free enterprise economy makes them this way and their personal aspirations, ambitions, and accomplishments are simply results of circumstance and luck, as the wealthy and the poor are equally dimwitted, amoral, and self-interested.","Feb 9, 2020"
2,I don't get it,"I really don't get why everybody thinks it is so good.

It is way too long and boring as hell.

The text messages in between aren't translated so you dont really know what it is about.","Nov 28, 2021"
2,Not worth watching,"A overrated movie,plane and simple. They should decide are the oscars about politics or about movies.","Apr 20, 2020"
2,Poor acting//overated film,This film has interesting scenes & cinematic direction but the suspense fell flat for me. Going into this film I thought it would be amazing because of all the reviews but I couldn't cling to the concepts. This movie is in no way a masterpiece.,"Feb 9, 2020"
2,Not as good as people said,"After the first half this movie went completely down hills. Over and over I kept thinking ""was this scene necessary, What's the point?"" right up till the end. Don't wait for a huge plot twist at the end either, this is not freakin' Sixth sense! And, I dig gory, and thrillers, but this movie is just a no for me.","Feb 16, 2020"
2,Below average movie,Whoever calls it a masterpiece just don't know meaning of masterpiece at all. I don't understand how this movie got oscar. It's just very normal average movie. Too much hype for this average movie.,"Apr 10, 2020"
2,It won best film oscar.....,"How? How did it do that? Oh yeah because the oscars have been rigged for years that's how.

Bad acting and a bad script with too many plot holes and chunks of total boredom.

If you liked it then good for you. If you're pretending to like it just to seem like you ""get it"" then you are only lying to yourself.","Jun 12, 2022"
2,Did we all watch the same movie?,"So the movie won an oscar, was claimed to be a masterpiece and so on. Like most Oscar movies they are either really good or really bad. In this case the movie was highly overrated.

Ignoring the fact nothing that is done in the movie is logical or would actually work in real life, the movie doesn't seem to know what kind of movie it is. If movies have a twist or something you didn't expect, usually you are like ""Oh wow, that was amazing!"". But this left me confused. Alot of what happens makes the movie feel pointless. Obviously this is a spoiler free review, so I'll just say some movies have good guys and bad guys, not sure if the movie makers understood what that means in this.

The only reason I gave it two stars was it was South Koreas first movie to get an Oscar.","Feb 10, 2020"
2,It's a sheer time waste.,"It's a sheer time waste. Till end you got bored, bored. I can't give 2 ranking too But i spent whole 2.11 hours that's why this is.","May 2, 2020"
2,It's a scam,One of the most overrated movies i've ever seen. The hype was for nothing and everything was predictable.,"Mar 16, 2021"
2,I dont understand how this movie got 8/10,This is a real bad movie. Nothing makes sense. There is no strong story or something to focus on. Its a waste of time !,"Apr 8, 2020"
2,This is Decidedly NOT a Best Picture,"Best foreign film -- I can't say. But best picture overall? No way. It's excruciatingly slow and the story has been done before. It's not particularly funny either (like that other Korean film from a year ago was).

I never connected with any of the characters or cared one bit about anyone.

Just another example of identity politics and Hollywood giving undeserved awards.

How did Joker get overlooked?","Feb 16, 2020"
2,Run fast from this movie!,"Every single minute of this movie I was wondering why, why, why, would anyone give any credit to such rubbish. How a terrible movie like this would get any praise at all! And I finally got the answer: Political Bleeping Correctness. ""Give an award to the different people even if the movie stinks""! A criminal con family. Are those the new ""heroes""? The Shawn of the dead is much better than this. Run fast!","Oct 24, 2020"
2,This movie took years off my life,I have no idea how this got any good reviews. It was confusing and boring. Not for me.,"Feb 17, 2020"
2,"Not a Fun Watch, Not Interesting, Not Quality","Parasite is a shockingly overrated film that provides no likeable characters for the audience to root for. If anything, the most likeable people are the wealthy family being taken advantage of. This can be forgiven, movies with bad people as leads can still be good but Parasite is a depressing and often ridiculous ride. There are completely unrealistic twists and turns and the final bloody actions of the main character seem unwarranted and mildly out of character. I left the theater feeling like I had not only wasted time but was put in a bad mood from the overly bleak nature of the film. I know I am in the vast minority here, as every other person I have talked to loved the movie, but to me Parasite was not just unworthy of a Best Picture award but was an terrible movie.","Jun 4, 2021"
2,I needed to read the 1 stars this time.,"I couldn't wait to watch this film after reading several 10 ratings reviews before, but after watching it today I've been compelled to agree with almost everything the 1 stars are saying here today.

The film did not live up to being a great Korean film, or best anything, and especially not Oscar worthy, where the only thing I enjoyed about this film was that view from their living room because the plot was an insult on a few levels.

And I'm not sure if anyone else had the same issues I had with the subtitles being extremely small to the point I was squinting trying to read the lines while watching it on Amazon Fire tv. That was a first for me, nevertheless, I understood enough to know that this movie was highly overrated!

What a huge let down, I think I want my 4.99 back.","Mar 5, 2020"
2,A major disappointment of a movie,"2/10 for this, this movie was extremely slow not engaging and tediously boring, if you want to catchup on some sleep this will work? This movie is one to watch. It seems the Oscar win for best picture was a diversity quota gift. I wouldn't bother with this movie

I saw 1917 when comparing it to this it was the deserving winner, but Hollywood is full of politics. This is the reason why ordinary people are losing interest in Hollywood and turning to streaming platforms in droves.","Feb 10, 2020"
2,Disappointment,I usually don't put in negative reviews but omg this was sooooo bad. 😑😑 bored out of my mind,"May 12, 2020"
2,Overrated,"Why this won best picture I will never know. The translation was horrible. Plot filled with holes, and so so acting.","Jul 19, 2020"
2,I don't get the fuss,"Movie was mediocre at best, and even that is generous. Tries a lot but accomplishes nothing noteworthy.

The film is pretentious, just like its critics. People read so much into it that it makes me sick. Everything is superficial, the plot barely makes sense, and there's no real tension. Well, many people seem to like the film, but I'm definitely not one of them. Rarely have I been so disappointed by a film as I was by this one. Even many B-movies are more interesting than this film. I can't help but wonder if some snobs just want to celebrate it because it's Korean-that's trendy right now. It reminds me of modern art: more show than substance. See it for yourselves, but as for me, I definitely won't be watching this film again.","Dec 12, 2024"
2,What a waste,"A waste of time, of energy and of the stuff that award trinkets are made of. Why this shallow so-called satire has received accolades around the globe is far beyond me, but there you go: it's the emperor's clothes all over.","Apr 24, 2020"
2,Terrible excuse for the best picture oscar!,"Saw this movie today. While well acted and photographed, the story was nothing exceptional. Interesting for a while, yet waiting for something better to happen which never occurred. The last third of the movie turned dark and disturbing not only for the violence but the silly way it ended leaving me shocked at how it won the best picture Oscar. The first thought I had as the final shot ended the movie was: ""Are you kidding me?"" The all time worst choice for best picture ever!!!","Mar 3, 2020"
2,I dont understand why...,Ok .. everyine give high rating but i said this is a bad movie.. the acting is good.. but the movie is not..,"Jun 28, 2019"
2,Took about 11 tries to finish it.,"People kept recommending it so finally I pushed through to the end and what a drag it was. It seriously too about 11 tries to finish it. Slow, boring, unlikeable characters, disqusting. It had good photo so 2 stars.

Train to Busan is a different genre (or rather it has a genre) and is a much better Korean movie. This was just boring.","Mar 5, 2021"
2,It's not what i expected it to be.,"By it, i mean Oscar worthy.

Like some of the rest here, i did not get it. With so much discussed about metaphors and the likes, I am either not good enough to read it or too casual not to over-read/read into somethings that's not there in the first place.

The movie tries too hard to be clever and it unfortunately ends up alienating people like me who come in hoping it may draw you in like the Shawshank redemption does.

My humble view notwithstanding, my congratulations to the Director for his Oscar win. It's a fabulous nod to Asian Cinema. It doesn't hurt that a ton of people here enjoy it too. That's the beauty of films, some like it some don't.","Feb 11, 2020"
2,Honest review. Overrated,"It's overrated, it doesn't deserve to be in 250 at all, nor does it deserve to be higher rated than 6. There is no point, the first few minutes are funny, then predictable. You will be waiting for something to happen to justify that above 8 rating and show why it's on 250, but nothing happens. It is entertaining a bit","Dec 4, 2019"
2,Kari On Korea,"How in God's name this got an Oscar is beyond me. Starts very well as a concept and even holds ones attention for the first hour. After that it becomes simply daft and corny. In fact it becomes pure Kari On. Definitely a big mistake to throw Oscars at it, I'd throw Soy Sauce. Give it a miss.","Feb 17, 2020"
2,It's not as good as the ratings make it out to be,"It has good start which quickly wraps you in and you get curious all along but once they're set in the plot, the movie dies down quickly until the 'last event'. The last event wasn't too disastrous except Mr. Kim's action. The naivety was tremendous from the housewife and tries too hard to sell. For the acting, it was top notch from everyone involved. The film is decent but don't go in with too much expectations as it's now nominated for oscars as well.","Jan 14, 2020"
2,Really?,"It's a travesty that this won Best Picture over ""Once Upon a Time...in Hollywood."" Very predictable. I kept waiting for it to turn into a great movie. It didn't.","May 23, 2020"
2,Disgusting,"I didn't enjoy a single minute of this movie. OK, the plot was interesting, the actors were good, but when ALL of the characters are unpleasant and most of them are a bunch of lazy, nasty parasites I can't have any positive feelings. And it is not about being poor. The characters in Slumdog millionaire were in worse situation, but there was so much more humanity there... Here, I saw an example of a mental cesspool.

1917 was my choice.","Feb 14, 2020"
2,What's the hype?,"I don't understand the hype surrounding this movie. First, similar subjects have been covered many times before, e.g. ""Shattered glass"", ""Catch me if you can"", ""Bling ring"". Second, this film isn't particularly educational or anywhere near a real event. Third, this film doesn't even stand out among Korean films, the acting, cinematography, scripts are good but not great. I'm sure most people would have no recollection of this film in a few years because it's a movie about ... nothing.","Feb 9, 2020"
2,"plotting, scamming, farce","This is a black comedy with peculiarly oriental sense of humour. It involves plotting, scamming, farce, and a series of increasingly bizarre events that eventually spin out of all control, with a macabre twist.

If you laugh at people having accidents or enjoy the Japanese game shows where contestants have to eat large maggots or suffer cockroaches crawling all over their faces, then you'll probably enjoy the humour.

If you're not on that particular wavelength then you might struggle with some of it. The film won the Palme d'Or at Cannes, but as with Barton Fink - another winner - the award seems increasingly to be a measure of novelty.","Dec 16, 2024"
2,Too Unpleasant,"The plot is very good, with loads of twists and turns. However, I did not like this movie. It was an entirely unpleasant experience.","Nov 10, 2019"
2,Poor is the new great (it seems),"I watched Parasite with an open mind. I deliberately avoided reviews (far too many fake ones out there) and even the trailer. After sitting through it, a film that in all honesty made two hours seem like three, then coming onto IMDB to see what others thought, I'm astonished. Let's begin with the positives though - cinematography was good, acting was okay(ish)... and that's about where it ends. The negatives are considerable though: A weak script which often made little sense or logic, more plot holes than Swiss cheese, ridiculous scenarios that defied belief and an ending that completely falls off a cliff edge and leaves the viewer wondering why they wasted two hours on this drivel. In reality I'd probably rate it a 4/10, but as at time of writing Parasite sits at 8.5/10, which is farcical given how weak this film is, I'm giving it a 2 to try and restore a bit of balance and common sense. I am gobsmacked at how many on here are rating this a 10 and can only presume that it's down to a complete lack of quality movie experience or, more likely, that some are so oversaturated in the endless stream of CGI comic book garbage we've all been subjected to over the last decade+ that anything, ANYTHING that strays from the rut immediately garners a flailing of arms and lauding of ""Best film EVER!!!"" Thirty years ago this film would've been where it deserved towards the low end of the barrel, but in today's distinctly subpar cinema offerings it's now being tipped as on Oscar possibilty. Utterly ridiculous. For those of you who are praising this film as the best thing since sliced bread, go and get yourselves a film education. A good place to start is Claude Berri's marvelous 'Jean de Florette' and 'Manon des Sources' to see how it should be done. Films you actually don't want to end, rather than praying for them to finish one hour in.","Feb 8, 2020"
2,Another attempt at pretentious social commentary,"Parasite (2019) is widely renowned by many members from the film community. At first glance, it appears that they are genuinely praising the movie's artistic quality but the truth is, they are merely praising its supposed profound social commentary and propaganda.

In a society where people prefer to stay in echo-chambers and repulsing those who don't fit the status quo, it is no surprise that this motion picture is highly acclaimed given that it appeals to the ideologies of Marxist lunatics today by making the audience feel sympathy for the poor characters and contempt for the wealthy ones.

The movie doesn't necessarily condone the main characters' actions as it still portrays their crimes in a negative light. But that leads us to another issue; the movie wants us to think that their crimes are the results of ""genius"" planning even though their plans are only made possible because of some stupid plot point that requires us to suspend our disbelief. It just goes to show how much the film is trying to insult the audience's intelligence by thinking they'd buy into it.

In summary, the director Bong Joon-Ho seems to believe that class and status indicate one's character, as evident by his attempt at portraying the main characters in a positive light despite them being a bunch of lazy and conniving criminals. Perhaps, the only redeemable quality of this film is its cinematography which admittedly is quite beautiful.","Jun 30, 2023"
2,Clueless where the high ratings come from,First half was ok- acceptable. Second half full of farfetched storylines and violence.,"Oct 4, 2021"
2,A Textbook Film Of Pretentiousness,"The opposite of a singer who sings with soul is a singer who sings *as if* they have soul. This movie was done *as if* it were a satire, *as if* it were making a statement, *as if* it has a deeper meaning. Instead, it's hollow at its core, mean-spirited, and pointless. It's a film for those like the idea of making a point but not having to suffer any uncomfortable truths.

The only good effect of this film is that it exposes the vacuity of those who praise it and their self-delusion. It's a barometer of the public's appetite for garbage. See this film only in the context of a sociology experiment and be shocked at how far we've fallen in our gullibility and how desperate we are not to face ourselves.","Nov 21, 2019"
2,"Started okay, turned ugly and dumb",So the super smart members of a poor family (why don't they get real jobs?) take advantage of the gullibility and kindness of a successful rich family to take jobs in the rich family's home (getting other people fired to do it) and then abuse that kindness...with a totally stupid ending...and this is supposed to be a statement against capitalism? How this trash won the Oscar when there were so many good nominations that year is a mystery.,"Nov 15, 2021"
2,Very disappointed,"The film won the Oscar for the first time in the history of Korean films. I wondered where it was better than other Korean movies, so I went to see it. To be honest, I'm disappointed. The film is too stereotypical and many plots are stiff. There's a lot better than this movie, and I can' t understand it won the Oscar.","May 13, 2020"
2,I tried to like. I really did.,"This movie was well written, well acted, and the theme (the have's & have not's, & what they do for personal gain and how to keep it) was, indeed, vividly executed. I'm just regretful that it spent so much time on the dark sides of human nature. It's my own fault for sticking with it to the bitter end, but can you blame me? It's a pandemic, for crissake! I've already watched all the movies that actually make me feel good about the human race. This just isn't one of those.","Apr 19, 2020"
2,Very disappointing movie,"The movie won an Oscar, so I went to watch it with interest. But I was very disappointed! The actor's performance is good, but many of the plots of the movie are too rigid to make people seem stupid. Many people say metaphors, but I think that's a stereotype of class. The film portrays the poor as unscrupulous, and the rich are stupid. The director may express something worth thinking about, but the carrier of expression, that is, the plot of the film is stiff and failed. I'm puzzled that this film won an Oscar.","Mar 20, 2020"
2,Terribly overrated,"This movie lacks depth, nuance, and completely misses the mark when it comes to emotionally impacting its audience. I'm baffled how this film has won so many awards as it doesn't draw one in to really care about what is being shown. It's silly, shallow, and makes for an okay horror flick but if you're looking to learn something, be moved or gain new perspective I suggest just reading the newspaper instead.","Feb 17, 2020"
2,Huh?,"At a loss to figure out why this film 1) won best picture of the year US Oscars 2) Cannes Palme d'Or. Also at a loss to understand why film categorized as a comedy.

There are moments of humor, but they are few and far between. The violence is also unwelcome.

On the Oscars award: ""Joker"" is a much stronger candidate. At least the audience has been advised of the violence in advance.

Save yourself time, and possibly money. Skip it","Feb 13, 2020"
2,Everyone is awful,"The idea that the Kim family are underdogs simply because they're poor is what makes this movie unenjoyable. I like dark comedies as much as the next guy, and I like watching well-deserving people get their just desserts. But every single character in this film, minus the Park kids, are just so awful - to each other, to others, to themselves - that I never felt any sympathy to the Kims and instead just sighed my way through the movie thinking, ""oh my god, of course this is where this is going because what else could possibly happen.""","Feb 7, 2020"
2,How has this got such high scores and reviews?,"I don't understand how this did so well as the movie is really substandard compared to other movies that come from this region. The way it's scored across all sites I thought it was going to be as good if not better than Oldboy. The reviews kept saying stick with it and there's a mad twist at the end. So I stuck with it even though it bored me half way through and the twist at the end was so underwhelming I was a little bit angry and wasted my time. This scored a strong ""Meh"" with me. Dont waste your time","Jan 20, 2020"
2,The reviews are misleading,"Ludicrous movie. I can't understand the reviews. This movie is full of insane people acting completely illogical. The poor are lazy and threacharous, while the rich are naive and simple. Don't believe the hype.","Jan 8, 2020"
2,Not that great,"I really don't know what planet some of these reviewers came from but this is definitely not a fantastic movie. The characters seem stereotyped and lacking depth. I tried, I often go to see movies that don't fit the box office genre but in my opinion, this year's award was looking for one of this genre, rather than it being a top movie deserving an award.","Feb 20, 2020"
2,"One of the worst movies of the year, the real horror is that it got so many good reviews","This movie is horrible on so many levels, its remarkable: The story/script feels like something a committee of teenage boys constructed during one drunken night, and the execution is mediocre at best (thanks to few OK actors) but overall painfully cheesy. But the true horror is, that this movie received so many awards and highly positive reviews. It makes me question the sanity and taste of humanity in 2019. If that outcome was the intention of the director, then he is a true meta-genius. In summary, skip this movie under all circumstances - its a true waste of your precious life time.","Sep 28, 2019"
2,What a freak show,"If you like this movie, you have a sick taste. Literally. You light laugh and be surprised during the movie, sure, but the ""message"" in this movie is given to you in the first three minutes. Poor people are evil leaches trying to lure the rich. What a fantastic message. And this film was given four Oscars? Laughable.","Apr 19, 2020"
2,Overrated,"If you watch this movie you will probably like it or love it. Why? Because you are supposed to love it.

It's not a great movie. It's not even a good movie.

It is completely implausible, slow moving and has very little story.

But you will like it. Everyone already told you to like it.","Aug 10, 2020"
2,An overrated movie,It does not deserve all the Oscars it has got and its just an averagely done movie. More deserving movies have been left out of oscars just to oppose the government. Such a shame.,"Apr 20, 2020"
2,Absolute mediocre,A mediocre movie. Did not get at all what all fuss is about.,"Feb 26, 2020"
2,Opens well only to become an epic fail,"As a fan of foreign films I was excited to watch this after its Oscar success, but unfortunately it collapsed in its second half -- so badly I had to abandon viewing it.

The opening of the film, introducing the starving Kim family and their machinations to secure work as the household staff of the Park family. It beautifully demonstrates the life in the city slums, with superbly executed plots to get the Parks' existing staff fired and replaced with the Kims. These plots become progressively more cruel, showing the Kims' slide into villainy.

The complication arrives when the former head maid asks the Kims if she can retrieve something from the Park house. Here the Kims truly become villains, manipulating the secrets of the house for their own gain and even turning to overt violence to preserve their position. It is here that the film loses its way.

Though certainly the Kims and their rivals have difficult choices to make, they are depicted as being gratuitously cruel. Each faction needs to remove obstacles, of course; each faction shows no restraint, fine. But the film lingers on this wickedness for so long, the audience becomes estranged to all of them. We no longer care about ANY of these characters because they have all become monsters; we abandon watching their fight because we have better things to do with our lives.

The failure of this film (as with so many of the last few decades) is in the writing and editing. The sets are beautiful, the camerawork superb. But the film lingers on human suffering purely for the shock factor. The suffering of the Kims is sadly reality for those at the bottom of South Korean society, and desperation makes villains of us all, but this is not a documentary. This is meant to be entertainment, something people can enjoy. Angela's Ashes depicted similar levels of poverty yet still maintained the sympathy of the audience.","Apr 17, 2020"

2,Shocked by the great reviews : Are they fake?,"The film started off well and an interesting concept started developing However , it suddenly turned into mayhem and utter stupidity . It was nonsensical .

Yes, I got the message about the rich and poor divide etc etc but that's nothing new and just reality . I was disappointed in this movie as I'd read great reviews. It was an utter waste of time !","Dec 23, 2021"
2,trash,"I do not like the Korean films, I do not think that they are as transcendental or innovative, much less films that remain in the memory of the viewer as the American ones of the past and I think that people only see them because of the crisis that Hollywood is going through. Sorry my bad english.","Jun 7, 2021"
2,Well filmed but trivial story,"Firstly, two warnings: 1. No real spoilers below. 2. My wife and I did not like this film at all (but note we also hated Pulp Fiction and Little Miss Sunshine which were also very popular with many people).

The cinematography was excellent. Beautifully filmed and showing bits of Sth Korean life that I had never seen. Of course, some aspects, the unemployed family and the wealthy family themselves were probably atypical.

We both thought the story and most scenes were quite ""old style"": trite, contrived and quite trivial. The film didn't venture into slapstick thank goodness but the lines and jokes were simple old ones transposed into a modern setting. I chuckled slightly ONCE during the film. Just not my sort of humour (give me ""Kives Out""). In terms of drama it was a bit like watching grass grow, OK interesting grass but that was all.

The ending had a strong message but was executed in a completely over the top and ridiculous manner, and out of all context (style-wise) with what preceded.

I can understand why a lot of people loved this film, and laughed a lot (although noone else was laughing in the cinema when we viewed the film). It has some strong elements in it but just dragged out too thinly for me.

Worth seeing this film just in case it is your thing.","Mar 1, 2020"
1,"Hugely overhyped, a disappointment in the end","I have been watching (and trying to watch) Korean movies and TV in the past year and my biggest two issues with Korean style movie making are that they overdramatize the mundane and they make the police/authorities hilariously incompetent. Both of which (no surprise) showed up in this film. They spend so much on the emotional part of film making and none on realism.

The ending - any half decent detective would have pieced it all together, including the cellar.

The invitation - why would any sane house-sitter invite a total stranger into the house?

Everything about this movie is frustrating, it's like watching 90s hollywood action flick. All emotions, no realism.","Jan 3, 2021"
1,One of the most over hyped films of 2019.,After the hype train of this film hit critical I avoided this as I didn't want the hype to taint my view of it long enough I forgot about it. I recently watched it and boy oh boy was I disappointed. I think if it weren't for the edgy champagne socialist clique that controls the opinion of the world this movie would have died in obscurity as it rightly deserves. There is nothing good I can say about this. It's everything pretentious and wrong with those who think they are so in touch with what's cool and everyone must obey and see the world as they do.,"Aug 2, 2020"
1,Predictable and empty,"I am happy people are giving a try to foreign-language films, but I couldn't consider this a masterpiece: The film is boring, predictable , the characters are really not interesting, and they made a really dramatic mood to make an obvious message, I don't see any necessity of exaggerating such a simple meaning. The rich and the poor cliché","Feb 14, 2020"

Thank to all those who helped to make that piece of garbage!","Apr 5, 2022"
1,Dangerously depressing,"This film made me feel so depressed I would actively discourage anyone from seeing it who feels down at times. I do always try to be as positive as I can when talking about anything but this film made me feel so hopeless that I don't have anything positive to say about it. It left me in a really dark place and I wish I had never seen it. No-one will like seeing this film, critics may have given good reviews, but none of them could say they enjoyed the film. It makes you feel so depressed that since this is something I do struggle with, it affected my mental health after watching this.

The quality was really disappointing, I predicted everything that was going to happen at every point in the story and none of the main characters felt anything approaching realistic as they were extremely one-dimensional and horrible from the opening moments with a completely age-inappropriate relationship involving one of those characters throughout the film. But most of all this is a film which is completely rotten to its core. The worst film I have ever seen. Avoid it if you want to enjoy yourself.","Sep 15, 2021"
1,On Screen violence and terror; NOT anupstairs/downstairs,A veiled approval of violent interaction between the 'classes' this is an incredibly disturbing movie which should NEVER have been granted Best Picture as the first Foreign language film to get that acclaim. Claims of stealing the plot are still under legal review. SHAME on the Academy for this dirty little movie...others of the year were far more deserving,"Feb 24, 2020"
1,It's not a korean movie.,"Horrible movie. There's no script at all. All the humble people - ALL - are portrayed like animals, with no principles. The director way of filming is disrespectful to the actors, which is not common in Korea. Korean movies are more elaborated, respectfull, and deep. This movie is empty.","Jan 27, 2020"
1,WTF is this???,"I was excited to see Parasite, due to rave reviews, and it winning best picture. I was warned by a theater worker that ""the first half-hour is slow, but then it gets really good"". So I made it through the first half-hour, and kept waiting for the ""really good"" part, only to find out that it was the exact same; more tedium by a family that was not really likable. The violence was not necessary either, and seemed to be a way to make it Oscar worthy. A lot of Oscar nominated movies have violence at the end, and that seems to be a way to get more respect, or something. It was sad, and horrible, in my opinion. I cannot wrap my mind around the fact that this movie, compared to 1917, Little Women and Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, won best picture! Honestly what is going on with those who vote, that vote for this drivel? It was okay, don't get me wrong, but that's all--merely okay. (For the record, I love movies with subtitles, and have seen several amazing ones, but this was not one of them.)","Feb 16, 2020"
1,Disappointed,After all the hype about this film and the number of awards I was very left feeling very disappointed with this film. Whilst it may have achieved what it set out to be. It seemed neither one thing nor the other. For the most part I found it completely predictable.,"Feb 23, 2020"
1,Are you kidding ?,"The brutal and violent film about awful, greedy, evil people. Academy Award for BEST PICTURE ? B**ch please. Should have been nominated for best international if so. Winner just for the sake of inclusivity - try to change my mind.

Overall, misunderstanding. Nothing artistic about it. Nothing beautiful about it. A film about parasites - all the leading actors, all that insane and disgraceful family. Didn't enjoy at all it made me angry instead. Oscars have fallen completely with THIS as the main winner. U gotta be kidding me. 1/10, as I couldn't give any less. Oscar winner, this one ? Big mistake. HUGE.","Jun 22, 2024"
1,Even worse than Us,Calling this movie dreck does a disservice to dreck. Message is simple: Wealthy people crazy and evil. Poor people understandably crazy and evil. Only redeeming quality is dramatic twist at halfway point but even this soon resolves into poor people crazy and understandably evil. Watched this because I had heard it had comedic elements and it had one if you think a pratfall is funny. Hopefully the only reason this got Oscar talk is to prove non-xenophobic cred of the Academy. Please stay away from this grossly overrated dose of depression.,"Feb 2, 2020"

1,Dont waste your time or money,"I can not believe that this movie won any awards at all. Horrible. It started off ok and transitioned into something where it seemed that the writer ran out of creative juice, then in a desperate attempt to write a movie script, just wrote a bunch of pointless drivel that had no real substance or connection to the story line. This was really 2 movies butted up against each other.

I think that the awards given to Parasite should be given to the next in line that did not win, because they were robbed. C'mon Hollywood. This is no way to show how 'woke' you are. I want my money back.","Feb 17, 2021"

1,Heavy-handed violence dressed up as social commentary (?),"This puzzles me to no end. My honest feeling is that the claim to offer some kind of social commentary is a layer of ""respectability varnish"" that serves as an excuse for filmmaker and viewer to indulge in the heavy-handed violence that tickles their fancy, and nobody wants to admit that because, well, their peers (and colleague critics) like it, so it must be good.

But then again, this seems so blindingly obvious that it's hard to believe that so many people fall for it. I'm honestly struggling with this: I think being critical and voicing social commentary is good and necessary, but movies like this feel rather as if it's part of the problem. They're ice-cold, de-humanising, disengaging. They make me care less.

But then again, maybe I'm just stupid and blind.","Nov 7, 2021"
1,"Highly rated, but repulsive story","In spite of the excellent reviews, this movie was painful to watch and absolutely repulsive. It got worse the longer I watched. So, what's my problem? I'm a pretty intelligent, educated 75 year old, and I am willing to watch edgy stuff. I can list a dozen edgy foreign movies with subtitles that were excellent, set in Iran, Turkey, Lebanon, and South Korea, etc. There are many moviegoers like me who need a little affirmation of the human spirit in films. This film has none. And, the reviewers who have rated it so highly can only be suspect for there sense of humanity and value. Beware the Metascore!!!!","Nov 15, 2019"
1,"PRESENTATION VS ""GOOD"" CONTENT","First I must admit Bong Joon Ho is a good director and writer. And Parasite is technically not bad at all.

However when watching a movie, it is quite rewarding to find some constructive citicism and good morals and principles. Well, in Parasite all you see is a man criticize at the way society works, with its undeniable flaws but, in the most destructive way I have ever seen. As he purposely doesn't leave room for good as he does for evil.

As Frank Capra said 90 years ago: ""all cried: Emancipate our films from morality... Kill for thrill-shock! Shock! To hell with the good in man""

1,8.6 !!! Are you serious!!,"The worst movie I have ever seen. The story is very bad and boring. Waste of time. I shocked when I saw that it got high ratings!!

1,"Gratuitous violence, lacks redemption","I don't understand high ratings for this and I don't understand the Oscar award. Grasping vicious characters abound; bloodbath and no redeeming message. I rarely walk out of movies and stayed through this one to the awful end, but I had to force myself to stay in my seat. Hated it.","Feb 23, 2020"
1,Overrated,"I can't believe that this movie is being called a masterpiece, it was ok at best. To me it feels like the director wanted to represent the feelings of the lower class population towards the rich but he failed miserably because its potrayal of both the rich and the poor is so illogical, I honestly felt like I was watching an adaptation of a bad fanfic. I think only people who are easily impressed would enjoy this movie.","Jan 5, 2020"

1,I didn't enjoy this film at all!,"I didn't understand the film. Maybe because of the Korean style of life! But for sure for me it was just a waste of time! At the beginning it seems to be a comedy, a stupid comedy, but slightly pleasant. All the characters seem to be stupid, liars, but also gullible children. But then, this stupid comedy turns on into a very bad horror movie. And at the end, ... a very stupid .... Happy end!

I don't know, maybe it is something wrong with me because so many people appreciates this film superlatively.... but steel I think I'm wright and the others are wrong or are manipulated by politics!.

I'm sorry, but in my opinion, this is a very bad and stupid film!","Feb 24, 2020"

Title is fitting though.","Apr 10, 2020"
1,I am confused as to how this movie is labelled as flawless and masterpiece,I was so curious to download this film ever since i read the reviews which are mostly positive. Turns out Parasite is just another predictable story that didnt put me on the edge of the seat as it was promised. I am seriously shocked Cannes chose this film to be its winner for 2019,"Dec 7, 2019"
1,Overrated,"It wants to be something that has been done before. That's ok. But it's not the best movie or the year, not even one of the best. Reminds me of other Korean or Asian movies in general. So, simple story, same old cliches, and a crazy, but somehow predictable twist in the second half. Would not watch it a second time.","Jul 18, 2020"

1,"Totally, completely boring and pointless","I'm a fan of a lot of international movies which break out of the Hollywood mold, but not this one. Could barely sit through it, and should have walked out early. It never got better. Some people seem to like it, but there are a lot of overly inflated reviews here. Maybe I'm rating too low, but I could not think of anything about it to rave about. OK...maybe the acting wasn't too bad, but the plot and script overall are a 1.","Feb 13, 2020"

1,A Cringe-Worthy Disappointment,"This film is what happens massive amounts of government funding is poured into a local film welfare system, since it now seems fashionable to have disdain for the west these days, most people in the west are practicing telescopic art appreciation, and the general public had been dumbed-down to the point that Hollywood can't make a dime with anything other than comic book characters. This film is visually dull and predictable. The characters are uni-dimensional and unrealistic, and the plot is beyond implausible It is Kung Fu Hustle without all the charm and CGI. My disbelief remained un-suspended through the entire cringe-fest. This film is beyond bad. It is insulting.","Jun 23, 2020"
1,Very boring,"Amazing why people love this movie, boring and very poor acting","Feb 16, 2020"
1,Would rather have parasites than watch this again,"I forced my way through the whole thing based on the reviews, it is really, ungood.

If anyone in their right mind thinks this should have ratings equal or close to movies such as No Country For Old Men of The Fellowship of the Ring etc should be locked in a basement under some wealthy strangers home whilst hiding from loan sharks.

The acting gives 2 stars but the dialogue dribble the characters are forced to say removes one of those.

Please do yourself a favour and read the low reviews prior to using precious time to watch this movie. You will notice a pattern with them.

One the positive side, Parasite has forced me to finally write a review.","Oct 1, 2024"
1,"One of the worst movies of 2019, I don't get the hype","I'm sorry, am I missing something here? Every celebrity, message board poster and even the former President of the United States Obama are saying this was the best movie of the year.

It's just not good! Why is this being considered one of the best of the year? I'm totally lost. This is one of the most forgettable movies I have ever seen. To put it bluntly, even Michael Bay's worst Transformers movie is better than this dreck.

I came into this movie thinking it was going to be the next City of God based on the hype. It's actually on the level of a movie on Netflix that I'd spend five minutes on before skipping to the next film and clicking ""thumbs down.""

Don't waste your time, trust me on this.

I forgot to add, it's very obvious that whoever made this movie ripped off Shameless in many ways. They were definitely inspired by it.","Dec 30, 2019"
1,Predictable and poorly executed.,Stunned at how anyone would think highly of this film. It should have been a short. Every aspect of the story line was so predictable and poorly executed. Not even a single spin that could have made it interesting. Do not pay to see this movie. Stream for free or just don't even watch it.,"Mar 9, 2020"
1,One of the worst movies in my life,"This movie even made me lose trust in all Oscars awards and IMDB ratings,

We've watched it as a family and we all hate it and regret the time wasted on it.","Apr 11, 2020"
1,It's ok to stand out from the crowd,"I am content with myself that I find I am literally the only person on the planet who hated this movie. I found the acting amateurish at best and the script was so wooden it's amazing they didn't carve the read sheets onto tree trunks. Not gory, not suspenseful, not entertaining, boringly predictable. 2 hours of my life I won't be getting back.","Feb 11, 2020"
1,If not for the ending...,"This movie was engaging and even suspenseful at times. The acting and directing are both very well done. But, the ending is over-the-top pathetic. Had I known, I wouldn't have invested 2 hours of my life for an utterly useless contribution to anything good. Pass. Save your 2 hours of life. Go for a walk. Rewatch Dumb and Dumber - you'll feel smarter than after wasting time on this attempt at a ground breaking movie. The Oscar win proves that Hollywood is morally bankrupt and void of ideas.","Feb 23, 2020"
1,The critics and award shows are wrong.,"This movie is rotten garbage. Main characters are unlikeable. The story as it plays out, predictably, is tedious. The characters lives are not interesting to watch. 36 minutes in I wondered if something interesting was going to happen. The movie is not funny and for sure not a thriller. The ending was ridiculous. I wasted my time watching this.","Jan 11, 2020"
1,Boring,I started watching this but I couldn't finish it. This says something because I am retired and I don't have much to do. Totally appalling characters. Even if there is a story I don't care because I couldn't care less about the characters. I wonder why it got distinctions. Every other Korean film I watched is better than this. In fact some of them were great.,"Jun 18, 2021"

1,Not that great,"I am sorry, I didn't like it...It could have been great, the topics were valid, but it was just not good.

1,Such an empty movie,Maybe I dont understand how to watch a movie or rest of the world dont understand how to watch a movie. I'm on the side of this movie is overrated movie. This film not deserve Oscar or something. Movie get all the awards because of there is a little political message. I will give hint also Kim jong-un,"Mar 3, 2020"
1,Neo-Marxism and Inverse Snobbery,"Repulsive story, highly prejudiced. The movie deals very unsuccessfully with the topic of social class struggle. Basically, the movie offers a violent tale of resentment and inverse snobbery. The rich are stupid and undeserving, the poor are a brotherhood of crooks, etc. It both denigrates rich and poor at the same time. It criticises capitalism and meritocracy but offers no alternative whatsoever. There is a dangerous apology of social revenge ( in the view of the movie, which sides ideologically with the poor, these are justified to kill the rich). It furthers violence, division and polarisation. Repugnant view of the world. Biased, Immoral, Unreal. Pure unadulterated prejudices. Not surprised that Cannes and Hollywood give it prizes. These awards are clearly political. Cinematic Quality has nothing to do with it. All this hype furthered my opinion about the inherent detestability of this very bad movie. Overrated is an understatement. Sick film, sick story. We live in decadent times. It is obvious.","Feb 4, 2021"
1,Overrated,"This movie is overrated. The only reason why it won an Oscar is because the Academy wanted to demonstrate to the world how ""progressive"" they are by (1) supporting a movie about class division and (2) desegregating the award categories so a foreign film could win best picture.","Apr 6, 2020"
1,overrated movie,"In general, what does a parasite mean a living thing, which leaves inside a host. And get its food at.the expense.of its host(which indirectly harms them).but in them movie they never robbed the rich instead they worked there , and at the last it sucks wtf is director telling trying to intellectual but not succeeding ... wtf.

And also they way he portrayed the rich and poor was nonsensical . This movie does'nt deserve the word ""masterpiece"" .Sorry, it's an ignorant view of world . For the people who call this masterpiece , you know what masterpiece movies are like , example( fightclub, interstellar, inception, tenet etc)....","Jul 8, 2024"
1,Absolutely overrated,"The idea behind it is not bad. But the realization is completely wrong. The actors seem incredibly incompetent and third-rate, a far cry from Oscar-winning acting. The dialog is flat and boring. The dubbing outside of the original soundtrack makes the whole thing even worse, which is a shame for such a well-rated movie.

And to underline the whole thing again... here is the same text again.

1,Just a really bad movie..........,"When I find myself constantly looking at my watch and asking when a film is going to deliver any of the promises that the Critics and Reviewers have seen fit to lavish on it then there's something awry. This isn't scathing socio-political cinema...it's not black comedy, in fact it's not remotely amusing or believable or even sympathetic to any of its characters. It's a simple hype job. The movie here is the real Parasite.","Feb 27, 2020"
1,Seriously Flawed,"It is incomprehensible to me that this film is acclaimed and possibly heading for an Oscar.

The primary flaw are the subtitles. The dialog has been translated by a poor cousin of Google Translate and NEVER reviewed by someone who speaks English. Grammar is out the window. Literal word translations miss the meaning. Subtitles are often flashed up so quickly that a native English speaker doesn't have time to read them.

The result of this subtitle travesty is that the plot is very hard to understand, particularly the mid-movie plot twists. The overall plot is clear by the movie's end and decidedly unremarkable.

The cinematography is excellent. The actors seem competent but reminiscent of Jackie Chan.

Overall rating a one ... of course the Hollywood sophisticates will disagree. Don't bother watching this unless you understand Hangul.","Jan 20, 2020"

If you like comic strip, then take it as that and enjoy it. Have a laugh. Otherwise its utter shallowness and the revelation of how deeply preposterous the acclaim is that has been given to its facile and puerile social commentary made me feel that I had been conned into taking my seat in the cinema.","Feb 20, 2022"
1,Disappointed,"Parasite has been on my watchlist for about a year now. I went in with exceptionally high expectations, given the glowing reviews and high ratings. Having watched it earlier today, I can confidentially say, it was the most disappointing movie I have watched, so much so, I felt the need to write a review. It's a movie that simply doesn't live up to its hype whatsoever. Not only is it a poor representation of the class divide that exists in many parts of the world, portraying a lower class family in a degrading and deceitful way, but most if not every scene that was meant to be suspenseful, was just outright anti climatic, to the point where I was like ""oh... is that it"". To make things worse, the movie was 2 hours long! 2 hours that I will never get back.","Nov 23, 2020"

I still curious by the rates (but didn't stand to watch it) so read the synopsys with spoiler instead..

Total waste of time.","Mar 21, 2020"
1,Sick movie,"Parasite is a parody of sorts that crosses genres (comedy, drama, horror). I rather liked the first part, but then the film de-generates into what could be ""sick"" territory.

The film touches on some important social issues (e.g., class struggle, relations among the various social classes) and has accomplished actors, as well as great cinematography, but that does not in itself make for a great movie.

This movie does not succeed as a comedy, drama or horror. The descriptors that come to mind for me are: repugnant, de-generate, immoral (or at least amoral), and having an 'eat the rich"" mentality.

Perhaps, you shouldn't pay too much attention to my ramblings, however. The film, after all, is rated well into the 8's and won four Oscars.

Makes me think of the Colosseum in Rome, which apparently was quite popular in its day.","Nov 20, 2020"

It's so obvious the twists happens for the sake of drama, which is so flimsy and laughable that WON'T HAPPEN IN REALITY, yet the critics fail to see that. Someone gives you jobs for your whole family and you cheat him by all means and hit him at his back to retaliate for no reason? It's just ridiculously dumb and stupid. Also the a lot of reviews are pretentious about all its meaning, which is such a joke, the meaning of this movie isn't deep its just complete idiotic, that's it. This is only another cult like the quentin tarantino's films, and a ton of korean movies are better than this trash for a mile, like cold eyes, battle of Incheon, always etc just to name a few.","Jun 15, 2021"

1,Not for me,"PARASITE (2019)

I watched Parasite out of curiousity after it won the Oscar. Well, I watched half of it and fast forwarded through part. The trailer repelled me, so I decided not to watch it before this point. The cinematography was wonderful, but once again, my view is in the minority in terms of public reaction to a popular film. I found the movie sadistic and disturbing. Rather than a provoking statement about class, I saw a dark, sick film laced with contempt, gratuitous violence, caricatures of people, and unlikeable characters with no moral compass. How utterly depressing.","Feb 19, 2020"

The Parasite that I watched was boring, meaningless, senselessly violent and did not evoke one emotion other than disgust and bewilderment that this movie won Best Picture. There wasn't one character that was even the slightest bit relatable and the plot was absolutely over the top unrealistic. It was a grand gesture for the Academy to award this subtitled, foreign movie, however, receiving an underdog award does not make the movie good. People are easily swayed and like to be part of the ""group"" who like a movie. Like ""drinking the Koolaid"".","Feb 13, 2020"
1,A PURE COPY.,This Movie Is a copy of a Tamil Movie. And Now Parasite's Director is sued. Don't Watch This movie instead of it Watch The real One. Parasite DO NOT DESERVE OSCAR.,"Mar 30, 2020"
1,Terrible,"I will not waste anymore of my time. I already wasted too much watching it. Terrible.

I guess great if you are Korean.

The oscars trying to make up for past mistakes........terrible movie.","Feb 10, 2020"
1,Parent rating a bit misleading,"I did not enjoy this movie at all and nearly walked out. My 2 adult daughters and I went, 1 had read the parent guide and was totally unprepared for the sex scene. It was WAY too graphic. We ended up looking away from the screen, but it was disgusting. Add the unnecessary vulgarity and violence and I was sorry I wasted my money. Both families were trash in their own special way. I left feeling pretty dirty by the experience. I'm not naive about human behavior, but in a day where the media pushes divisiveness, I felt like it was driving the wedge deeper by promoting hatred and distrust between the rich and poor. There are solutions to our issues and I wish the media (including ""entertainment"" media) would stop pushing their agenda.","Jan 20, 2020"
1,"Overrated, non-logical events","I really do not know how is it rated over 8. Too many plot holes, too much drama and lack of build-up make this film very hard to watch. Is it rated that high because the majority of voters are Korean? A waste of time.","Jan 12, 2020"
1,Way Over Hyped and Way over rated,I'm not asking anyone to agree with me ... but I did not find this film beautiful moving or touching in any way shape or form... nothing that happened in this film was believable... and if we just give out acadamy awards for a bunch of random crap happening in a movie .... there is a reason this one won 4... don't fall for the hype and accidentally pay for this film like I did... waste of money and time...,"Feb 25, 2020"
1,Overrated movie,"It makes no sense of the situations. Some scenes were good but the movie is too long for the story. Also, the plot is very predecible in a lot of things. I don't recommend this movie.","Jan 13, 2020"
1,It's a Long Time Since I Walked Out of a Movie,What a wreck of a movie; filled with thoroughly loathsome characters plodding through a sophomoric plot towards a thoroughly predictable end (we didn't bother to hang around to confirm our expectations but having now read some of the reviews I see we weren't far off the mark). The frequently high ratings for this travesty leave me totally mystified.,"Nov 10, 2019"
1,didnt like it at all,"Waste of time waste of money, frankly speaking i didnt like it at all","Nov 8, 2019"
1,Ayn Rand Would Love This...,"The director seems to have a bone to pick with poor folks. He's like, ""Hey, look, poor people are just freeloaders living off the sweat of the rich!"" It's as if he believes the rich are the hardworking, upstanding citizens while the poor are just leeches.

But wait, it gets better! The movie practically screams, ""Rich people are awesome, and they totally earned all their wealth."" Yeah, right! Most of us know it's often about nepotism and inheriting stuff, not blood, sweat, and tears. The director might as well be the president of the Ayn Rand fan club, shouting, ""Greed is good!""

As for the movie itself, forget about comedy or horror-it's just plain bonkers and uncomfortable to watch. Imagine sitting down to watch if you're barely living and making it? If you are a maid? Is this what your boss thinks of you as a maid? It's like the poor cannot be trusted. That's a recipe for some serious awkwardness!

And don't even get me started on Cannes. It's like a gathering of eccentric ""artists"" who think they're creating something groundbreaking. But honestly, most of the recent award-winning movies, like this one, are just plain junk. So, if you're looking for a good laugh or a spine-tingling scare, ""Parasite"" might not be your cup of tea. It's more like a cup of confusing, uncomfortable, and downright weird.","Sep 23, 2023"
1,Dumb,Just goes to show you most people like dumb shows. Not sure what the hype is. Political,"Feb 17, 2020"
1,How do bvb u read and watch a fikd at the same time,It's in a foreign language they should add subtitles to the top of the screen instead of the bottom so that way you can read it and watch it at the same time,"Jan 6, 2020"
1,Trying to Be Intellectual But Not Succeeding,"This movie is trying to say that capitalism is causing both the rich and poor to become parasites - the poor are scam artists lying for money, and the rich are using the poor to nurture their kids. But it's a mess of a story, not a ""masterpiece."" In the real world, the poor definitely have to fight major barriers to get ahead, but this movie doesn't have any depth - the symbolism is amateurish, the characters are one dimensional and inconsistent, and the dialogue between rich and poor is totally unrealistic. The movie makes it seem like the poor are all scamming, bumbling psychopaths, and the rich are all naive and emotionally clueless. Sorry, it's an ignorant view of the world. It makes me realize how disconnected from reality the entertainment industry and its official reviewers have become. Or maybe Hollywood is trying to gain more money and audience share in overseas markets so they promoted this one.","Feb 15, 2020"
1,What is the point?,"I don't understand what the intention of the director is? What does he want to explain or to prove? Is it a critic of social inequalities? Is it a thriller? A comedy? I don't know and none of these styles is addressed adequately. This movie is clearly overrated. For sure, it is deranged and make you feel very uncomfortable sometimes. But for what purpose? I don't know. It proves one thing: that the Cannes festival is a get-together of crazy bonkers who call themselves artists - which clearly they are not.","Oct 27, 2019"
1,How on earth did this win an Oscar?,"I am flabbergasted, I went expecting so much from an Oscar winner, and my cousin has relocated to Korea and loves the country, and was left speechless. The plot is tired, the characters unlikely and I was just bored. Half the cinema had their phones out. In fact a 5 minute trip to the toilet felt like blessed relief from the tedium. I will never get that evening back. Shockingly bad.","Feb 19, 2020"
1,Way overrated,"Good actors, well filmed, but the story is predictable and too depressing. It does not deserve at all its oscars and all this fuss about it.","Feb 10, 2020"
1,Shameful that this won best picture. And this shouldn't even be on IMDB's list of best movies!,"How did this win best picture????? The ending was nothing special and the storyline didn't make sense. Not a good film in general and to think that this won best picture, TRAVESTY!!! I saw this and Cats(2019) in the same day... and cats was WAY better. At least in cats it was visually entertaining, this doesn't have anything to show for. Would not recommend and still don't know what the hype is about. Save yourself time and money and skip this film!!!!!","Mar 27, 2020"
1,Awful movie,The stupidest movie I've ever seen. I'm really sorry for those who voted for this junk movie.,"Oct 21, 2020"
1,Sick empty drivel,"I don't have time to write about this sham of a movie. I've already wasted enough time watching it. the movie had no message, no lesson..just bunch of liars and criminals. If the Korean culture is like that then I am definitely steering clear. I have no idea why everyone around me seems to love this movie. What happened to the world?","May 9, 2020"
1,Shocked at the Positive Reception,"I went into this movie with very high hopes. So many accolades and Oscars have been thrown at this movie, and while that's not the main requirement for a great movie, it gives off the impression that there has to be SOME redeeming qualities about it. I was excited to see a foreign-language film win Best Picture and was fully prepared to at least enjoy the movie as a social commentary, as many people lauded it as a powerful work of art and ""masterpiece"" (a word that is used WAY too often these days).

So basically, I hated it. I got about an hour and a half into the film before my mom and I decided we had enough and couldn't succumb ourselves to watching the rest of this cartoonish sequence of events, despite the fact that I rented it. I could state a plethora of reasons for despising the film but to summarize my thoughts, I felt that the characters were underdeveloped and acted more like caricatures than real people we encounter, the film's aesthetic was not pleasing for the viewer to watch (and I understand that the movie's uneasiness was the point but I was not a fan of the directing style and the strange shots) and I kept thinking some bizarre creature was gonna come out and fully push this film into fantasy/horror genre. I just really did not like anything about it. I usually always finish movies once I'm dedicated to watching something but this was just impossible. I get some of the messages the director was trying to make but it comes off as a complete joke to me that this film won so many awards, including BEST PICTURE. None of the characters were likable. Absolutely none. I'm not sure if I was supposed to hate the rich family for just being rich and slightly conceited and root for the poor family because of their circumstances, but they didn't seem to have any empathy or compassion for even other working-class people like them in the pursuit to get what they wanted which came off as very cold and sad. I love films that make you question who the protagonists and antagonists are and I know not all movies are meant to be uplifting, but these characters were lazily written and we don't get any insight into their inner monologue and feelings. The acting was very mediocre for the most part too and sometimes downright cringe-worthy.

I truly don't know what I missed but this was just not my cup of tea (or my mom's) and it felt unnecessarily gruesome and strange rather than masterful and sharp. Instead of awaiting the next moment with excitement and suspense, I found myself cringing at the actors' performances as they weren't believable and was confused at how poorly-written the dialogue was. Not everything that's out there and different hits the mark. This did NOT hit the mark for me.","May 16, 2020"
1,All hype,I assumed this movie would be good because it won an Oscar but it's just overrated anti-capitalist tripe. Don't bother.,"Feb 24, 2020"
1,Waste of time,Made me feel depressed it was a waste of time and it overrated for no reason,"Apr 11, 2020"
1,An average rating is an insult to the word average,"Let me say from the outset that I love films that are extraordinary. They take you out of your comfort zone, full of surprises, and have a totally new slant on the art of film making.

Well, unfortunately Parasite is none of these things.

There are very few films I have actually walked out of the cinema before the end out of pure boredom. Sherlock Holmes with Robert Downey Junior was a notable 'lowlight' (truly truly awful!).

Well Parasite has just joined this illustrious group.

I'm not going to criticise or question the sanity of people who say this is a masterpiece. That's up to them. But I genuinely just don't get it.

Awful acting, boring dialogue, no direction...this film has no redeeming feature in my 'humble opinion'. Hence the title of this review - this film isn't average...it's way, way worse than that.

But go see it yourself - you may love it.. Just don't try to convince me that this is anything more than a total snore-fest.","Apr 17, 2021"
1,leaves me with just hollow emptiness,"Everybody and his aunts seem to love this movie - and I can't figure out why. Yes, it's technically well done but so what, many movies are well done. There is not on character of interest to me and nothing makes sense to me.","Jan 23, 2020"
